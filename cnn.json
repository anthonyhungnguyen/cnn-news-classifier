Nick Kyrgios taunts fan after being heckled", "cate": "sport", "content": "Nick Kyrgios is no stranger to sparking drama and controversy on the tennis court, and on Sunday it was a verbal spat with a heckling fan that animated the Australian at the Miami Open. The 23-year-old Kyrgios reacted after he was taunted by a spectator sat behind him in the first set of his 6-3 6-1 victory against Dusan Lajovic. Did you get a free ticket? Why are you watching me on a Sunday night? Kyrgios shouted up to the stands. You got nothing else to do on a Sunday night?The man in return gestured at Kyrgios, who three points later shot back with Bro, where's your fam? While his female companion remained seated, the spectator was eventually escorted out by stewards and Kyrgios waved to him from the court. Addressing the issue after the game, the 23-year-old said that he had a bit of fun with it. I knew that I was going to get him kicked out, he added. I loved it, I loved every single bit of it. I think the crowd loved it.Kyrgios explained how the incident originated with the man joking about his haircut. At a change of ends he literally just said, 'You're a d*** .... He said I had a s***ty haircut. And you know what? I haven't been to a barber shop in a couple of days, so he was pretty right, said the world No. 33.On the court, Kyrgios produced a bag of tricks as he swept past Lajovic.The first set alone saw him twice experiment with underarm serves -- one of which resulted in an ace -- and win a rally that included a tweener (through-the-legs shot).A semifinalist in Miami in 2016 and 2017, the Australian next plays Croatian Borna Coric in the round of 16. Kyrgios has hit the headlines a number of times during this tournament. In an earlier doubles match, he called the umpire a f***ing disgrace and smashed his racket on the floor in frustration. He also called out Angelique Kerber after the former world No. 1 told her third round opponent Bianca Andreescu she was the biggest drama queen as they shook hands at the end of the match. Bruh you said she is a drama queen and then post this, Kyrgios wrote on Twitter, replying to Kerber's message congratulating Andreescu on the victory.Last month, the Australian was criticized by Rafa Nadal after his defeat of the Spaniard at the Mexican Open, a tournament Kyrgios went on to win.[He] lacks respect for the public, the rival and himself, said Nadal after a match that again saw Kyrgios deploy an underarm serve. He's a player who has the talent to win grand slams -- a player who can fight for the top rankings -- but there's a reason he is where he is.World No. 1 Novak Djokovic needed three sets to defeat Argentina's Federico Delbonis 7-5 4-6 6-1 in Miami to set up a last 16 clash against Roberto Bautista Agut.Roger Federer will be aiming to join him on Monday when he faces Serbian Filip Krajinovic.

{"title": "Colin Kaepernick: A cultural star fast turning into a global icon", "cate": "sport", "content": "No one had noticed Colin Kaepernick sitting on a bench as the American national anthem rang out during a pre-season match on August 16, 2016. No questions were asked, no objections raised. There was no indication that the quarterback would become America's most polarizing sports star. Perhaps it was because the then-injured Kaepernick was not wearing his San Francisco 49ers uniform on that summer night in Houston.Six days later, at a home game with the Denver Broncos, Kaepernick was still injured, still protesting, yet fans, journalists, the 49ers, the NFL and its owners were still unaware a storm was brewing. But on August 26, after a game against the Green Bay Packers, a reporter looked closer at a picture of the 49ers and noticed Kaepernick sitting alone near the coolers as everyone else around him stood while the anthem played.Questions were asked. Word spread. Kaepernick became the most talked about athlete in America. A villain to some, a hero to others. I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color, Kaepernick, then 28, told NFL.com's Steve Wyche, the man who broke the story. To me, this is bigger than football, and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder.This was a star quarterback in America's most popular sports league. A black man with a black biological father and a white biological mother, adopted by white parents who raised him in the predominantly white northern Californian town of Turlock, drawing attention to police brutality. It was not, he would reiterate, a protest against the military or the flag, over the next two years, drowned out by the ire and the applause. A tiny ripple quickly built into a wave which aimed to sweep down the walls of oppression. From San Francisco to Seattle, from the NFL to the National Women's Soccer League, from elite sports stars to college kids, there were with Kaepernick against injustice. For the 49ers' fourth preseason match Kaepernick took to one knee during the anthem; his teammate Eric Reid joined him.On the same night Seattle Seahawks' Jeremy Lane sat for the anthem. Days later Megan Rapinoe was the first white athlete to take the knee, doing so before a professional soccer match, and on September 9 Denver Broncos' Brandon Marshall became the first NFL player to do it in a regular-season game. Two years on, Kaepernick is unemployed after opting out of his contract in March 2017 before the 49ers could release him and has largely maintained a public silence over the last 12 months. But he is more powerful than he has ever been.  begins, and the  the country's most influential American footballer, the symbol of a movement, isn't anywhere near the pitch. But he returned to the spotlight this week when it was revealed Kaepernick, a Nike athlete since 2011 but not featured in its campaigns since his departure from the NFL, would be the poster boy for company's 30th anniversary Just Do It ad.With a black and white picture of the kneeling quarterback-turned-activist superimposed with the nine words, Believe in something. Even if it means sacrificing everything, Kaepernick has returned to the forefront of public debate. He didn't have to say a word, or make a single play. Over these last few days his supporters have been inspired, his critics emboldened. Nike trainers and socks  the hashtag #boycottnike was trending on Twitter through much of Tuesday. US President Donald Trump, who last year described the NFL protesters as and whose frequent comments on the issue has fueled the flames of national debate, said  sent a Kaepernick and Reid, who like his former teammate remains unsigned, received ovations at the US Open last week when they were shown on the big screen. Former CIA director John Brennan lauded the former 49er, and by using Kaepernick Nike -- a multibillion-dollar company whose interest lies in selling sportswear -- has made it clear  They are not with the President on this.Whether the majority of the NFL's white, conservative billionaire owners like it or not, Kaepernick is the face of the league which the player himself believes blacklisted him. The man who would spend his time time as a player quietly attending lectures at the University of California, Berkeley, to learn about black history is a cultural star, fast turning into a global icon. He's monumentally more famous than he ever was as a player, Nate Boyer, a former American footballer and Green Beret, tells CNN Sport.He's probably one of the biggest pop culture icon at least out of sport that there is and it's all due to the demonstrations, it's nothing to do with football really.Boyer has been closely associated with the protest since the beginning, writing an  to Kaepernick that was published in the Army Times, which culminated in a  between the two men. During that meeting, Kaepernick was persuaded by Boyer to kneel for the national anthem rather that sit as it showed, in Kaepernick's words, more respect for the men and women that fight for this country.Boyer admits he did not think the issue would become as big as it has, but urges Americans to be smarter and calls for the man who is now known for a simple, silent gesture to be more vocal. To really believe that half of our country is stupid and your side has all the answers and the other half doesn't have a clue is ignorant, he says, answering one of hundreds of questions he has been asked on Kaepernick this week, though the pair have not spoken for a while. I want to get back to unity in this country. I think Colin can be a big part of bringing us together, but it's going to take him being vocal, being involved with people on both sides of an issue and reaching across.I know Colin can do that because he did it with me, so he's capable of that. More Americans need to see that because we don't see it, we just see reactions to one side of the story. I would continue to encourage him to be part of that. Around the time Kaepernick met Boyer, the player was as much a part of the public discourse as the Presidential election, making headlines with his words and actions. He received death threats, his teammates voted him the winner of the Len Eshmont award for inspirational and courageous play, Time magazine put him on the cover kneeling next to the words The Perilous Fight, and earlier this year  honored Kaepernick with its ambassador of conscience award. Described as the Muhammad Ali of this generation by civil rights activist Harry Edwards, Kaepernick promised to donate $1 million of his salary to various organizations and continued to speak out, saying that cops are being given paid leave for killing people. That's not right. That's not right by anyone's standards. But, aside from social media posts, the former 49er has been quiet since the end of 2016. He has not spoken to the media since he  against the NFL, accusing the league's owners of conspiring to keep him out because of his protests.The NFL has attempted to have the case thrown out, but last month the arbitrator determined that Kaepernick's lawyers had unearthed enough credible evidence to allow the case to proceed to a full hearing. It will no doubt keep Kaepernick in the news during the NFL season. There are no shades of gray when it comes to Kaepernick. Everyone has an opinion. Even Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, former President of Iran, tweeted this week: ... unfortunately once again @Kaepernick7 is not on a NFL roster. Even though he is one of the best quarterbacks in the league.Though his form dipped since his starring role against the New England Patriots in 2012 which led the 49ers to the playoffs and, ultimately, the SuperBowl, statistics suggests Kaepernick is still good enough for the NFL. He threw 16 touchdowns and four interceptions in 2016, while in that November he had the best first-half performance by a 49ers quarterback since Steve Young in 1997. Much has happened to the young player who gave rise to Kaepernicking during the 2012 season, a reference to the act of kissing his tattooed biceps to celebrate a touchdown. Those tattoos led one columnist to compare him to a prison inmate, his first brush with being the cause of fury.Of course, Kaepernick is not the first black athlete to make a stand against social injustice and suffer as a consequence. Craig Hodges was a sharpshooter for the Chicago Bulls and outspoken on a number of issues, from poverty in the black community to the Gulf War. He turned up to the White House's congratulatory ceremony in a full-length dashiki with an eight-page letter intended for President George Bush. He was cut by the Bulls that offseason and never played in the NBA again. John Carlos and  shook the world at the 1968 Olympics by raising their fists on the podium during the American anthem. They received death threats on their return to America and were suspended from the US track team. Former broadcaster Brent Musberger, when writing a columnist for the Chicago American, described the Olympians as a pair of dark-skinned stormtroopers. And there is The Greatest, Muhammad Ali, who refused to fight in Vietnam. The heavyweight champion was stripped of his crown and reduced to making a paid appearance at a boat show in his hometown of Louisville, his passport taken away, along with his ability to make a living.In the absence of football, the Nike deal gives Kaepernick a worldwide platform and such a major endorsement will likely give other athletes further strength to stand by their convictions in an age where the country's most commercially viable stars are in open opposition to the President. Athletes perhaps have more power than they realize. What this might mean is that there is space for athletes to be part of this conversation about race and social justice without having to risk their endorsements and I think that's important, Professor Louis Moore, associate professor of history at Michigan's Grand Valley State University, tells CNN Sport. I hope it gives companies the same confidence to support athletes too. That they will see that maybe having an athlete who is politically engaged isn't bad.But Kaepernick's voice could have been louder, says Moore. Kap stayed silent for a year. He could've taken advantage of 24 hours news, social media, but he stayed silent, he explains.  Ali, he stayed active, he did tours, he was on the news, he did radio. Kap stayed silent for a year. In that sense, he has an ability to have a bigger platform because of social media but he didn't use it.But he'll always be in that conversation about those key figures, Ali, Smith ... He's a part of history, in a good way too.Over the last two years Kaepernick's conduct has not been without fault: he has worn socks featuring cartoon pigs wearing police uniform, a t-shirt featuring former Cuban dictator Fidel Castro, and was heavily criticized for revealing that he did not vote in the 2016 election. But he has been successful in affecting the national dialogue.He forced us to have a conversation about race and racism and police brutality and he forced people to wrestle with this reality that these things exist in America, says Moore. Whenever a black athlete speaks out it highlights issues. That's his impact. It's a conversation that's been going on for two years. It's going to be an ongoing conversation. This is where we're at as a nation. Kaepernick will be part of that conversation for a while because of Nike and also because the NFL has started. That conversation around criminal justice and police brutality is front and center in America right now, not only because of Kapernick but because we have cameras and we see all this stuff all the time on social media, on the news, and that's something we have to deal with as a country. At the start of his protest, Kaepernick said: I am not looking for approval. I have to stand up for people that are oppressed. If they take football away, my endorsements from me, I know that I stood up for what is right.The football has been taken away, the game goes on without him, but his message is louder than ever. "},
{"title": "NFL: From Texas to New York, tailgating fuels football gamedays", "cate": "sport", "content": "Throughout his four years as a football player at the University of Texas, Todd Bondy had little awareness of the revelry taking place just outside the team's stadium. It was only after completing his football eligibility and remaining on campus to finish his degree that Bondy, a fullback on Texas' vaunted 2005 national championship team, felt he may have been missing out on something big. It was quite an eye-opening experience, he says of attending his first tailgate party. It's a sunrise to sundown situation for many. Freed from his seclusion in a team hotel the night before a game, Bondy mixed with Texas students who camped overnight in spots to toss footballs, barbeque, and engage in a fair amount of drinking leading up to kickoff.It's a hyper-social experience and mini-reunion every week for a lot of people, he says, noting that he went back to every tailgate that semester, and the fun thing is they are all rallying around Texas football.Since the very first college game played between Princeton and Rutgers University , tailgating has gone hand-in- hand with American football as a celebration of fandom unmatched by other sports. And the parties keep getting bigger.  Now an investment manager in Austin, Bondy was back on campus on September 15, shuffling from one tailgate event to another before his Longhorns played their rivals from the 2005 title game, USC.They ranged from high-end alumni affairs, with deluxe buffets and open cocktail bars, to ones set in parking lots, where fans pitched tents, positioned big screens alongside beer coolers, drank shots poured down ice blocks, and stood on long lines at porta-potties.Tailgating is a uniquely American experience, notes Daniel Shepherd, a native of Kent, England who moved to Austin with his family after stints in Dubai and Hong Kong. We got season tickets the moment we got here, he says, sporting the burnt orange Texas colors on his cap, sunglasses and tee-shirt.  For us as Brits (tailgating) doesn't exist. You get a little bit of a pregame stuff at the bars, or something like that, but this is incredible. Shepherd attended his first college football tailgate in 2016, for an Alabama game at Louisiana State University -- a school consistently ranked at the top of the tailgate party list. He and his wife arrived in Baton Rouge three days early, parking their RV and enjoying a marathon session of Cajun food and booze interrupted by lawn games of horseshoes and cornhole. The fact that Alabama won 10-0 in a drab matchup, didn't matter: Shepherd was hooked.  We're new to Austin, new to Texas, and new to the US. We thought it was a good way to meet new people, he says, before the USC game. I haven't paid for a beer yet today.Others, like local operations manager Steve Lawrence, never even make it to the stadium, which swelled to a record attendance of over 103,000 for Texas' 37-14 win.He showed up at 9:30 a.m. for the 7 p.m. kickoff, but didn't budge from the parking lot. I get tickets all the time, and I get rid of them and stay here at the tailgate, says Lawrence, who has been setting up at every Texas home game for 11 years. We're broadcasting the game right here; all my friends are here, we're all together. Tradition, along with licensing laws, stipulate that no money is exchanged among tailgaters, with unwritten rules that everyone chips in. Beer sponsors, like Coors Light in Austin, often drop off large coolers of free samples for tailgaters who grill steaks, burgers and lobsters, along with more exotic fare. Adam Goldstein, who authored the book Tailgate to Heaven about his tour of all 32 NFL pre-parties, sampled fried alligator in Jacksonville, deep fried Turkey in Buffalo, and bear meat and raccoon fajitas in the parking lot outside Raymond James Stadium in Tampa before Super Bowl XLIII.I flew back out for four days to live in a car park with no water, with 300 other RVs and big screens to watch the game, says the Oxford, England native, who balked at the $1,800 cost to watch Pittsburgh beat Arizona in person.Goldstein lists the Oakland Raiders' Bad Boys of Barbeque as one of his favorite tailgating crews -- They had a grill the size of a horse trailer; they were cooking for 300 people, incredible food, couldn't be more hospitable, he says -- and is mightily impressed by the stamina of Green Bay Packers fans, who tailgate despite the frozen winds around Lambeau Field. For Goldstein, a Chicago Bears fan who doubles as a drama teacher, youth worker, and the coach of Oxford University's American football team, part of the appeal is the ritual's ability to mitigate a loss.With tailgating, you're still having a great day, even if you don't win, he says. The soccer experience is only about results. If you win you have a good day, if you lose you have a bad one.He remembers attending an FA Community Shield at Wembley Stadium feature Manchester United, and was aghast that there was no razzmatazz, no pregame, nothing. Then again, it is hard to match the outrageousness of the Detroit Lions' Tubgators, who roll out a giant hot tub complete with fans in swimming gear braving the Michigan weather, or the flair of the University of Washington's sailgating crew, who float in the bay adjoined to Husky Stadium.  New York Giants fan Hank Uberoi organizes one of the most lavish tailgates in the NFL, with plans for up to 70 people -- some flying in from London -- to meet outside MetLife Stadium for this Sunday's showdown against the New Orleans Saints. An avid food and wine connoisseur, Uberoi's crew includes celebrity chefs Nelson Yip and Floyd Cardoz, as well as the president of Zachys wines, who has supplied a six liter bottle of Bordeaux on occasion. The cross-border payment company director has procured 24 game tickets and 18 parking passes so far -- but the real highlight will take place before the game, where the convoy will set up seven tables and three grills the moment the lot opens at 11am.His musician son -- who once set up and performed with his band at the tailgate -- is flying in from Austin for the occasion. We have a very eclectic group of people, from hedge fund managers to carpenters and everything in between, he says, thankful that a few teetotalers volunteer as designated drivers. It's very collegial. You end up chatting with the people next to you, particularly given the type of food we do. Everyone is welcome, everyone pitches in.Despite enduring the Giants worst season in 40 years in 2017, and a rocky 1-2 start this season, Uberoi's gameday ritual remains unhinged.Tailgates are an independent event, he says, though he does have one issue to consider. The parties can get in the way of the game -- or vice versa.My wife complains because we've never made the kickoff, he says. So last year we actually attempted to do it, but we still missed it. "},
{"title": "From humble beginnings, Gay Bowl attracts NFL sponsors and touches lives", "cate": "sport", "content": "Magic, it seemed, was possible any time Dorien Bryant touched the ball.Electric runs like the 98-yard opening kickoff return for a touchdown in front of 108,000 at Penn State, or the 95-yard score at home against Northwestern, or the touchdown catches of 53 and 41 yards against Indiana State peppered his college football career.Bryant left Purdue University in 2007 as the school's career leader in all-purpose yards, setting multiple Big Ten conference records before signing with the Pittsburgh Steelers. Yet just a year later, the playmaker was out of football, walking away from an offer from the Tennessee Titans and reportedly ignoring a call from the Dallas Cowboys.I came out when I was 24 or 25, Bryant tells CNN Sport of his decision to live openly as a gay athlete about a year after ending his NFL pursuit. It was more of my choice, I didn't try and push it. I never wanted to be a figurehead for a movement; I don't want to be that guy.For the first time since childhood, Bryant, who also ran track at Purdue, took a break from sports and focused on himself. Football became an afterthought.It was either football or being able to live my life the way I want to live my life, and I'm happier than I ever was, he says. I love football, but if I can't be me then it's not worth it. Now Bryant is back in the sport as his true self, featured as the go-to receiver for the 2017 champion New York Warriors at Gay Bowl, the annual tournament of the National Gay Flag Football League. Fifty-seven teams from 22 cities battled it out in 100-degree Denver weather last month, in seven-on-seven matches that provided a remarkable level of athleticism for a recreational league.Bryant is one of at least seven players on the Warriors with college football experience, recruited by teammate Wade Davis, a former Tennessee Titans signee who won an NFL Europe title with the Berlin Thunder. The competition has progressively gotten better, says Davis, 41, a figurehead in the league who takes the Warriors' quest to repeat as Gay Bowl titleholders seriously. The other teams have had to figure out how to get better players and better coaching.Over the past 18 years Gay Bowl has grown from a three-team tournament played in the dirt field of a Hollywood high school to a three-day event held in rotating cities boasting 35 sponsors, including United Airlines, Fidelity Investments, Sheraton Hotels and UPS. Rosters represent a mix of races, genders and sexual orientations -- and welcome straight players, though their numbers are capped by a quota. Everything is well organized, from the shuttle buses, to the singing of the Canadian and American anthems, to referees in striped uniforms who sound a lot like their NFL counterparts.Games are governed by a , and formed by two 30-minute halves, with tackling replaced by the removal of an opponent's flag belt.I never thought in my wildest dreams that it would get this big, says co-founder Jim Buzinski, but now it's so institutionalized. Cities are bidding for this.Honolulu, in fact, recently beat out bids from Austin and Toronto for the 2020 games, while New York will host its second Gay Bowl next year.The New England Patriots were sponsors of last year's Gay Bowl in Boston, with owner Robert Kraft speaking at the closing ceremony. This year the Denver Broncos made a financial contribution and worked with organizers to boost the tournament's reach.This shows that an issue the NFL probably would have avoided at some point in the past, thinking it was controversial, is now so accepted in mainstream that it seemed a no-brainer to be a part of, says Buzinski, who also co-founded the news service Outsports. It is so routine that no one cares.These are all football players and football fans, which is kind of a good business decision. It shows the progress that has been made.For most of the 1,000 or so participants of Gay Bowl, the long weekend represents a reunion of friends and a celebration of football -- the sport they love, which in many ways shaped their lives.The majority of my friends in DC are in the league, says James Santos of the Washington Generals, a former Air Force enlistee who would go on to win this tournament playing receiver in his fifth Gay Bowl.  I have friends who met in the league who got married. I've been in weddings, birthday parties, and one funeral. They are like my family outside my immediate family.Flag football was also a means for Santos and his sister, who plays in the female league, to come out to their conservative church-going parents from Texas. How my parents grew up, it was really frowned upon, he says. You were just not considered normal, you were considered weak and a sissy.That's just not the case at all, so for them to see that type of contact and passion ... it's just eye opening. Santos' parents now attend their games often and are really into it.These are like everyday people that love sports, he says, adding that flag football helped dispel damaging stereotypes sometimes associated with the LGBT community.What would do wonders for the perception of gay male athletes, Santos says, is to be represented by a prominent pro. Like Jackie Robinson for black people, or Billy Jean King for women, we need an equivalent of someone like that to come out -- a stud athlete, says Santos, who is black. It would be okay. They are not going to lose their jobs. Bryant agrees. Sheer numbers tell you there are a few LGBT players in the NFL and in the NBA as we speak, he says, it's just that those guys are afraid.The former Purdue standout wonders how things may have turned out if his shot at the NFL happened now instead of a decade ago. He points to Arizona State University signing openly gay high school football player My-King Johnson as a step forward. There is more of a conversation like that in professional sports now, he says. It's slow, but it's progress.It appears that football's locker room culture -- which nearly drove former Patriots offensive lineman before coming out -- must evolve for a gay superstar to emerge. Bryant's Warriors teammate, former San Diego State strong safety Shaun Rogers, says his personal life took a backseat until his athletic scholarship ended. Playing football is always like, how is my team going to respond? How is everyone going to respond? says the 35-year-old brand innovator with heavily inked arms.  I don't want nobody to feel uncomfortable about the situation, so I kind of just suppressed it, he adds. After college, I just became more open with it.There was more freedom, I didn't have to worry about my teammates -- even though they were my friends. I just didn't have to be around that culture.Alongside Bryant, Davis and Rogers are Stephan Benjamin, a 6-foot 4-inch, 211-pound former wide receiver at American International College, captain Preston Roberts Jr. from Worcester Polytechnic, and quarterback Chris Allison from Columbia University.Gelling with the LGBTQ league's ethos of inclusion, Roberts and Allison are two of the Warriors' five allotted straight players, with no more than three allowed on the field at once.Both prefer to play in New York's gay flag football league, rather than the ragtag games they were a part of in the city. I can't think of a straight league that is on this level doing this type of stuff, says Roberts.This is legit, says Allison. First off, everyone's got a jersey. Then you've got the tents (shielding resting players from the sun), you've got websites, you've got first aid here. Everyone's got a plan of action.A lot of these leagues we've played in have been ad hoc, you've seen fistfights, he adds, noting that in the gay leagues people get a little chippy from time to time with competitiveness. But if there is a fight, you're gone. It's not acceptable.During his first practice, the quarterback felt a different vibe straight away. Everyone was super friendly with a lot of camaraderie, and so I said 'Why don't we give it a go?'Roberts says joining the New York Gay Football League -- which welcomes straight allies on its website -- was by way of an understanding with Davis.He's taught me a lot about this league and about LGBT, so he's only expanded (my mind), he says, but he wouldn't have invited me to the league if he didn't think that this is something that I could become a part of.If you're a gay participant and you invite a straight player, you probably trust them to be open enough.It's the opening morning of Gay Bowl XVIII and players on the vast green field on the outskirts of Denver are slow to get into a rhythm. Maybe a few too many carried on at the welcoming rooftop party the night before. Bryant, who doubles as a personal trainer for budding college prospects and a bartender in New York, is used to playing on little sleep. I get off work on Saturday at like 5 a.m. and we'll practice at like 9 a.m., he says. Boasting a considerable size advantage, the Warriors dispose of their opponents convincingly.If anyone on the field is keeping track of which three straight players are playing for each team, it isn't apparent. Enforcement has always been based on an honor system, and by all accounts it works.I'm not going to say it's never come up, says Roberts of the Warriors' inclusion of high-caliber straight players, but relatively speaking, it doesn't. There is a rule for it, but it's not a thing. Playing in his fourth Gay Bowl, the former Ivy Leaguer Allison is one of several straight quarterbacks in the league, because -- just like in the NFL -- good flag football quarterbacks are hard to find. I'm sure there are a few people who are frustrated about it, he says. There is definitely a debate there. You have to balance it out and make sure we come to some middle ground where everyone can be happy.Buzinski explains why a quota system was implemented after he founded the Los Angeles league. We didn't want a situation where a 'gay team' would have 75 percent straight players, and they were the best straight players in high school or college, and they would be ringers.People said, 'Well isn't that discriminatory?' No. You can play flag football in LA or any city in multiple leagues, so they weren't being deprived of an opportunity, he notes, adding that he never saw a serious violation.People policed themselves. Besides, there was no way we could really test for it, he says.There were some players that people would swear were straight, and then their boyfriend would show up.Joe Cooper of the Denver Summit, who was honored by the league as a Hall of Fame inductee this year, sums up the consensus.At the end of the day, you have a lot of gay men who say 'I don't care if he's straight or not, I'm still going to whoop his ass on the football field.'Not to be outdone, women have featured prominently at the Gay Bowl since their inclusion seven years ago.We're very, very competitive, specifically when it comes to sports, says the Denver Mile High Club's Aszur Rollins, who has played on six championship teams. We can be a bit brutal with each other.New to the city after finishing her tour with the Army, Rollins found flag football all encompassing, and even met her wife through the league.It's really been this amazing experience at an adult time in my life, she says. I never went to college, so I consider this to be like a college experience for me. I never had this comradery, this sports experience.Before she transitioned to life as a woman, Kaylee Parker played wide receiver at South View High School in North Carolina, battling several top college prospects in the state.The 38-year-old mechanical engineer moved to Phoenix in 2015 and began living full time as a woman, but missed the competition.Originally, I just wanted to play football, she says of finding her way onto the Phoenix Fahrenheit, and once I started playing, I ended up meeting a lot of cool people, and it's basically like my other family now. It didn't matter to me if it was a straight league or a gay league, but it happened to be what I found.Coming from a Phoenix league that is open to all genders, Parker's gender identity has not been an issue. But the Fahrenheit's team captain and quarterback admits she has received some resistance as a trans athlete competing in the women's division of Gay Bowl. Everyone has their perspectives, she says, adding that flag football is more about finesse, catching skills, quickness and strategy, and less about brute strength. So I think that the physicality of it goes out the window.(Her sentiment is echoed by Bryant, whose Warriors took fifth place this year. It's about who's smart, he says. You can have the 12 best athletes in this tournament and line up and still lose.)I think about it a lot, Parker says. I wouldn't compete if it was a tackle league.The other competitors, she feels, are perfectly capable of facing her across the line of scrimmage. I would think that it would discredit a lot of women if I said I wouldn't play.Perhaps the game is less physical than tackle football, but it certainly can be rough.One Warriors player is examined for a possible torn tendon in his knee after the team's very first game, while an LA Express player grumbles to Bryant that he lost a toenail in a collision.He acts like I did it on purpose, Bryant shrugs to a teammate, after encouraging the player to go to the first aid tent. It will grow back.Bryant -- who at 33 still sports a six-pack and the unmistakable frame of a pro athlete -- admits he was at first taken aback by the level of play in the league, then checked himself. Was he stereotyping too? You know what, you are kind of (surprised) at first, he says. But then when you step back and think about it, why? Why are we surprised?Because they are gay men? Like, we can play, he says, eyebrows raised, head nodding. It is a recreational league, but we can play."},
{"title": "Meet Pratima Sherpa, the teen golfer making history for Nepal", "cate": "sport", "content": "Tucked between the third green and the fourth tee of the Royal Nepal Golf Club in Kathmandu, there is a maintenance shed. Smaller than most household bathrooms in the US, this shed is home to a family of three. The parents work on the golf course, while the daughter -- in between studying and tending to a small flock of animals -- plays golf. But this isn't any golfer. Pratima Sherpa is the best female golfer in Nepal.And when she plays, locals press against the fence surrounding the course, eager to catch sight of the 18-year-old breezing so effortlessly between holes. Sherpa has become something of a Nepalese celebrity. Having climbed to the top of the women's national rankings, she now harbors dreams of becoming her country's first female golf pro.Nepal is a smaller country than most, and playing golf can be difficult for poor families like ours, Sherpa tells But I've got a big opportunity to play golf, and feel very proud and lucky that I've got that chance. I want to become a great golfer.Sherpa has a chance to break new ground for Nepalese golf. For a girl whose family home has no running water -- who first played golf with makeshift wooden clubs cut from trees lining her home course -- the chance to play at an elite level could be life-changing. A fund-raising website,, has been set up where members of the public can make donations to support her career. There's hope this money can help her secure a college place in the US with access to high-level coaching, regular training, and advanced equipment. But Sherpa won't be forgetting her home country -- a nation with just 700 registered golfers among a population of 29 million.  I want to develop golf in Nepal, she says. I will give back to the golf community in Nepal and will help underprivileged children enjoy the sport as I have.The Royal Nepal is just a stone's throw from the airport in the country's capital Kathmandu. There are a number of quirks and oddities that make it unique -- both as a place to live and to play golf. The regular players, for example, don't use shiny golf balls. Monkeys, mistaking them for eggs, are known to steal shots from the greens.The goats, chickens, and dogs kept by Sherpa's family, meanwhile, are hardly safe. One of their five dogs was eaten by a leopard. Then there's the weather. During the summer months, monsoons are common in Nepal; Sherpa is no stranger to crunching drives and measuring putts through torrential rain. In April 2015,  struck Kathmandu. With buildings reduced to rubble, locals were forced from their homes and 2,000 sought shelter living in tents on the Royal Nepal. For several months, Sherpa's home became a refugee camp.While this life may appear an anomaly within the sport of golf as most know it, Sherpa shares the same dreams and heroes as any aspiring professional. She admires Rory McIlroy, and on the women's side Michelle Wie; Tiger Woods has written her a letter of encouragement which, says Sherpa, shows he believes in my game.   Oliver Horovitz, an author, journalist, and golf caddy who met Sherpa at the Royal Nepal Golf Club and founded the fund-raising campaign, has high hopes this 18-year-old can become an unlikely face amongst golf's elite.   Golf has this history of exclusivity and really a sort of sad, restrictive path, Horovitz tells CNN. In a lot of countries, it's a rich person's game.The whole of Nepal has got excited about Pratima. They're so proud of her, and so supportive. It's really wonderful to see.She's an amazing spokesperson and an amazing icon for Nepali golf, and more generally for Nepal and women in Nepal. Sherpa recently spent five weeks in the US, her first exposure of playing golf outside Nepal. Coming from a country with just four courses and several hundred registered players, she was thrown into a country at the forefront of the women's game, home to four of the five major tournaments and over a third of the world's top 100 players. Undaunted, Sherpa competed in five regional tournaments in California, winning one of them and finishing in the top six of two others. In the US there are so many courses with so many different designs, says Sherpa. Some courses were very challenging, but it was important to go so I could learn more about my game and how it compares with the level in the US.Her attitude towards the game in the US caught the eye of golf coach Don Parsons, who instructed Sherpa in between tournaments. A coach since 1992, he has helped junior players in California progress through the ranks. I find it amazing that she gets so much joy from the game, Parsons tells CNN. She clearly absolutely loves hitting golf shots.She has an amazing opportunity to really influence a ton of kids over in Kathmandu, to do great things. She's inspiring a generation of kids over there.Equal to Sherpa's deep love for the game is her desire to improve -- and that, explains Parsons, is what really set her apart.Her face lit up every time she did something different to improve her game.Any competitive golfer that wants to be on the world stage is working hard. Not all of them have that joy for every single shot they hit.I thought that was a pretty striking difference from Pratima and other young players."},
{"title": "From 'the pits' to the Commonwealths -- how lawn bowls saved Tongan's life", "cate": "sport", "content": "Caroline Dubois is holding back tears. Standing before a throng of people as they begin their countdown from 10, she looks for her family in the stands. Her pulse is racing. Please don't cry, she tells herself. The Tongan cannot allow herself to lose her composure, not at the Commonwealth Games, not in front of hundreds of people, not with television cameras peering, and not with her teenaged daughter watching on. On the dry khaki-colored green lawns of Broadbeach Lawn Bowls Club on a sultry Australian morning, the 53-year-old places her feet on the mat. A gentle wind blows in from the Pacific Ocean. Five, four, three, two, one. She takes a deep breath before rolling the bowl towards the other end of the green. It's not her finest attempt, but it's not her worst. For when you've lived without hope, spiraled into a darkness no-one ever wants to go to and been engulfed with guilt for not being the mother you wanted to be, winning or losing matters little. The Dubois who once did not care about her tomorrows; the divorcee who drank too much, lost her job, her money, and nearly lost her daughter, is gradually being pushed to the past. Competing at the Games is another step towards burying her former self. This is where I'm dealing with it, Dubois, one half of the first lawn bowls team to represent Tonga at the Commonwealths, tells CNN Sport. It is 2013. Seven years have passed since Dubois moved from Australia to Tonga, her parents' native land, in search of the happiness she would never find. The businesswoman, a once successful executive for Le Meridien hotels, is working for a hotel she and her husband of 13 years have invested in. But the couple have drifted apart. The distance between them -- her in Tonga, him in Melbourne -- has turned them into strangers. Divorce papers arrive through the post. The Frenchman has had enough. Dubois' life comes crashing down. We had an opportunity to buy and invest with a group of people in Tonga, says Dubois, mother to 14-year-old Stephanie. What better way to learn my mother's tongue than to be there and run that resort? I felt like I needed to do other stuff and he couldn't understand what other stuff I wanted to do. I had a marriage and family, but I felt so empty. I needed something else. I forgot myself. We decided to compromise and find a balance halfway. He would visit monthly, but we drifted apart. If I'd known moving to Tonga would break up my family, I wouldn't have done it.Lonely and lost in Tonga, the now single Dubois became involved in a relationship which quickly turned toxic. The once responsible mother who rarely drank alcohol now drowned her sorrows in wine and liquor. Evenings would end in the police station after yet another quarrel with the man she knew she had no future. Negativity consumed her. I have big regrets, the regret of not being a mother to my daughter, says a melancholic Dubois, sitting around a table in the athletes' village. Wearing her red and white Tongan tracksuit, she blends in with many of the athletes coming and going around the plaza, though few will be afflicted by such torment. My husband was such a gentleman, a good father, a good provider, she says, her voice trailing off. Just to think of those days ... it was a shock to my family and friends how I became someone else. I was argumentative, fighting with my family. They despised my boyfriend and I was fighting for him.  It became abusive. It was a vicious circle. Here I was trying to fix him, and he thinks he can fix me and in between we're fixing it with alcohol. Tonga is not a big place and our family is respectful, a hard-working successful family. I go to the graveyard and have a cry there and just hope my parents can see me now.Dubois, this once healthy, affluent family woman, became to look older than her years. Her youngest sister, Pele, made one last attempt at trying to stop her gaunt sibling from self-destructing, giving Dubois a ticket to join her in Auckland, the city where she grew up and attended college before moving to Australia.I went to Auckland and my boyfriend was nasty on the phone, making me feel guilty, and I fell for that and I'd be back on the plane and my family kept paying for the ticket to take me back, Dubois remembers. During the school holidays Dubois' daughter, who lived with her father in Melbourne, would visit, but Dubois was not yet ready to be a mum to her only child. Dubois' family continued to search for solutions for the loved one they no longer recognized. But she was still drinking, still unhappy.They invited Dubois to the local lawn bowls club where Dubois' niece, a promising player, would bowl. She had no interest in the sport, but knew the alcohol would be cheap. I'd drink too much, and my sister and I would be at loggerheads around members, her friends, she says. It was terrible. In her good heart she thought going to the bowls club would keep me busy, but I saw it as an opportunity to drink. I'd be so embarrassed the next day.With another visit from Stephanie on the horizon, and following a tearful discussion with Pele, Dubois agreed to attend a training session at the bowls club.Life began to change.When it was explained that bowls wasn't easy and that it's an art of line and weight, I thought 'That's challenging, I love challenges.' I'll take up this challenge, says Dubois, offering up a rare smile. Dubois doesn't recall the moment when bowls became more important than booze, but she does remember lying in bed thinking about her new hobby rather than a bar. A healthy obsession had replaced a destructive one. She was always early to training sessions, listening attentively to her coaches. She would practice in the rain, in the piercing sun, even sneak onto the green when the club was closed. Family would ring her mobile, but there would be no answer. Dubois was on the green, rolling it up and down.The more I got into it, slowly my mental state was starting to change, she says, attempting to offer an explanation to a transformation she herself cannot fully shed a light on. I got more involved in training, got to know members' names and I started to think outside of me. It had previously all been about me, me, me. I was starting to separate myself from the negativity. I was breathing bowls. I couldn't wait to get up and go to the green and my family supported me. They'd drive me to games. The old me came back.With practice Dubois became good. Very good. In her first year she won an Auckland championship as a fours and shortly after was asked to represent her region, North Harbour -- one of New Zealand's best teams. I was so excited, she says. So much had changed so quickly. I had to slap my face. I'd beat all these women ... my name would start appearing in post sections, center websites, etc. We were given a mental skills coach and I think that was another saving grace for me. It helped my bowling, but it also helped me personally, though they don't know that. It was getting me back together, it was a big part in what set me straight. I never touched a drink, I was never even interested in alcohol. I'd have the odd drink after a game but as time went on I wasn't having that drink, I refused it. I don't know how the hell it happened, picking up that bowl, progressing and proving to myself that I could do it has saved me in so many ways.If I wasn't doing this where would I be? Would I be dead? Sometimes I used to think 'Who cares about tomorrow?' That awful side was winning.February 2018. Two years have passed since Dubois first held a bowl in her hand. She receives an email from Tonga's lawn bowls association, confirming that she will partner Malia Kioa, a fellow New Zealand resident whom she had never met, at the Commonwealths.  One sister said: 'Hang on, I think I'm just having a heart attack right now' when I told her, says Dubois, laughing at the memory.  Two other sisters are in Melbourne ... to hear the squeal of excitement when I called them. I could just imagine the tears that came with it.My daughter never answers her mobile, never answers a text, so I texted her and said: 'Can you keep a secret?' and she replied straight away. I said: 'Mum is going to the Commonwealth Games to play for Tonga.' I never got a reply back!Unbeknown to me at the time, she'd left her phone and ran to her dad and I got a call from him saying 'Are you serious?' I have spoken to him more in the last month than I did in the last five years. He's remarried. I am happy for him, but sad for what I lost, but I can't bring it back. I can't live with regrets.Dubois' daughter, her ex-husband, Bruno, and sister Pele are watching her first match, against Norfolk Islands. Go Mummy! screams Stephanie. Dubois does not want the match to end. It took me a few ends to settle. I was nervous, spraying the bowls. I was everywhere, she admits.They were only here for the weekend, so I knew 'This is it, after this match they're going to run off to catch the plane.' I wanted the ends to keep going because that meant Stephanie would stay. As soon as the match was over, my husband pointed at his watch, saying they had to go. I just threw my bowls in the bag and just ran. I just wanted that five minutes with them. She said 'I'm proud of you, Mummy. You go and get them.' Everyone has those demons and I'm sure there are worse demons than my demons. Hopefully, it'll inspire people.I find myself telling people 'find something you're passionate about, no matter what it is.' I found it and I went with it. Bowls was not something I was interested in, but I made it my passion and I made it interesting for me.It's paid off. All those cold, raining night and hot, burning days. Every day. I was so anal. 'Where is she?' She's bowling!'Dubois can often be found sitting on the balcony of her seventh-floor apartment at the athletes' village. It is, she says, a marvelous vista. She can see everything, athletes sitting on giant bean bags in the courtyard, others sometimes playing a giant Connect Four. Live music emanates from the bar. Tears will slide down her cheeks.Sometimes I just need that quiet moment to think about what I was looking for back then, says Dubois, looking into the distance. I never found it. I thought I wanted freedom, but what was I looking for? I still can't answer that. How much I've drunk I really don't know, but obviously I drank a lot because by the time I got to Auckland I had no money left and I did have money so that's a lot of money spent.Everyone said I was turning into an alcoholic, which I probably was, but in my mind I wasn't. Now the joke is I'm an international sports person!Someone asked me: 'What would the Caroline today say to the Caroline of five years ago?' I'd say: 'You bloody idiot.' Sometimes I cry for her. I don't see her as me. I don't want to know about her, but I still mourn her. Here I am talking about her in the third person ... But now I can slowly bury her.The tears can no longer be held back. Dubois cries, for the five years she lost and for what she has since achieved. The Caroline of today is the one I'm going with, she says, wiping away the tears with her fingertips.  I never want to back there again. That was the pits."},
{"title": "The menstruation app aiming to tackle sport's 'last taboo'", "cate": "sport", "content": "Hillary Clinton is on stage addressing the media, telling her audience she will take their questions when, mid-sentence, she yells: Oh no, my period! Seconds later, in a manic high-pitched voice, Clinton, then the US Secretary of State, declares that her country should nuke England. It's an unfortunate turn of events. Five years on and Queen Elizabeth II and her subjects are, thankfully, still alive and well. The big red button was never pressed, of course, as the on-screen meltdown was a scene in the American sitcom 30 Rock. The show's creator, Tina Fey, was mocking the perceived effect menstruation has on women. But periods can be a problem.For elite athletes, gaining a better understanding of menstruation could be the difference between success and failure, be the difference between competing with confidence or competing with dread.To help athletes and coaches gain a better grasp of how the menstrual cycle can affect training, performance and well-being, a PhD student in England has helped develop what has been described as a groundbreaking new app.  Launched in Boston this summer, the FitrWoman app has been downloaded all around the world, from Australia to the US and the Middle East. Co-creator Georgie Bruinvels describes the creation as a no excuses app.It provides people with an understanding and solutions about what they can do to reduce the impact [of the menstrual cycle], Bruinvels, an elite runner who won the Manchester marathon in her first attempt at the distance, tells CNN Sport. By inputting typical cycle length, period duration and the date of their last period, the app will calculate where the user is in their cycle and give daily, tailored, information on their physiology -- what is happening to their body as a result of changes in their hormone levels -- and also provide training and nutritional suggestions to reflect these changes. How much of an impact could such information have on an elite athlete's performance? In a world where coaches are ever searching for small, incremental improvements, it could be significant.Periods are often described as the last taboo in women's sport. Though sportswomen have talked openly about menstruation in recent years it is only, says Bruinvels, a handful who speak out.People are starting to talk about it more, which is great, but no-one is really doing anything about it, Bruinvels says. What can we do to help athletes?According to BBC News, around 200 million people worldwide have downloaded period-tracking apps, some of the most popular are Clue, Glow and iPeriod Period Tracker, but FitrWoman focuses on maximizing sporting performance during the monthly cycle. Bruinvels, a full-time sports scientist and researcher for the Irish sports and data company Orreco, developed the app with Grainne Conefrey, Orreco's product development manager. Ultimately, the sports enthusiasts are on a mission to pass on all that they have learned so that the prospect of young girls ditching sport, whatever their level, during puberty is diminished. But, so far, the app's main influence has been on the training and nutritional habits of elite and recreational athletes.Bruinvels' research paper on Sports, exercise and the menstrual cycle, published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, serves as the foundation of the app's expertise. Bruinvels and Conefrey also sent questionnaires to over 1,800 elite and recreational athletes to help gain a greater understanding of the impact menstruation has on performance.  From the questionnaires, the pair found that the menstrual cycle affected the training and performance of more than half of the elite athletes questioned, while it also impacted a third of the recreational athletes.During my research, I was finding more interesting information around the menstrual cycle, says Bruinvels.  How it can affect performance and what can be done to reduce that, and what caution should be applied at certain times of the month.Athletes train for every eventuality, but they don't train for their menstrual cycle.I know an athlete who competed in the Sydney Olympics and she said she came on her period the night before the race, because tapering, which is a reduction in training before big races, and flying can bring on a period. She was so underprepared that she didn't know what to do.In 2015, British athlete Heather Watson blamed girl things on her first-round defeat at the Australian Open, while two-time Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova has said periods could be difficult for females on the tennis tour. British long jumper Jazmine Sawyer, who uses the FitrWoman app, pulled out of a competition in Boston this year because of period pain and, a few years ago, British middle-distance runner Jessica Judd admitted that her running times could vary by 15 seconds depending on what stage she is at in her cycle.But periods, though still clouded in euphemism, are certainly not a curse. Paula Radcliffe first broke the women's marathon world record in Chicago in 2002 on the first day of her period, though she did experience stomach cramps during the final third of the race. A recent study, published in the journal Behavioral Neuroscience, found that women's cognitive performance, specifically memory, attention and cognitive bias, was not altered by the hormonal changes which happen during the menstrual cycle.But, in elite sport, research on the impact periods have on different athletes is limited. However, there is evidence to suggest women could be more susceptible to injury at different points of their monthly cycle as tendons and ligaments become lax and elastic around the time of ovulation, due to oestrogen levels being at their peak. Anne Keothavong's tennis career was one troubled by knee injuries sustained when the former top-50 player was menstruating. Adapting training regimes could prevent injuries, says Bruinvels.Risk of injuries, like anterior-cruciate ligament or other soft tissue ligaments, is increased when oestrogen levels are high just before ovulation, she explains. When you have high levels of oestrogen, it means stability is affected. The most important thing is understanding. They need to have physiological awareness of why. There are certain times of the month when you are stronger so you can lift heavy weights, but there are certain times, to get the same benefits, you don't have to lift those heavy weights. The best thing we've had is athletes saying 'if only we had your app, we wouldn't have the injury problems I have now.' The injury risk is huge, especially in team sports like football and rugby.If athletes train smarter, focusing on endurance when oestrogen and progesterone levels are starting to increase, switching to high intensity and resistance routines when oestrogen is high and progesterone is low just before ovulation, then, says Bruinvels, the risk of injury will decrease. As well as giving information on when to lift or stretch or run, the app also informs users about what to eat and when -- iron and carbohydrates during menstruation, for example, healthy fats towards the end of the cycle.Heat and humidity can affect an athlete during her period, too, because hormonal imbalance can cause the body's core temperature to slightly rise. But there are solutions: hydrating before and during exercise, and drinking sodium-based electrolyte drinks to make sure the fluid is absorbed. Whey shakes and fish oils, says the app, can reduce anxiety and stress during a period, while it advises users to eat protein with every meal during menstruation: Protein and slow carbohydrates will help maintain your energy levels, stabilize blood sugars and reduce cravings.When you're pre-menstrual your blood sugar is more likely to fluctuate so we recommend foods to counter that and eating regularly, Bruinvels explains. During a typical 28-day cycle, a woman's hormone levels will change daily, which is why it was historically men, rather than women, who were tested for medical research. Around the time of the first and second world wars, due to potential harm to unborn fetuses, it was decided that research should be done on men and not women, explains Bruinvels.More latterly, it's been appreciated that women are different and that women have cyclical hormonal fluctuation, making them more complex to study than men, and way more expensive. Typically, when research is conducted in women, it'll be when they're bleeding, which is when their hormone levels are low and therefore most similar to men, or on women who are on the contraceptive pill, or studies just ignore the menstrual effects and don't consider it at all, which is catastrophic.It is still, it seems, a man's world. During a recent lecture before around 400 tennis coaches, Bruinvels was shocked to learn the largely male crowd did not know about the physiological differences between men and women. It led Bruinvels to ask: what if these male coaches helped women train like women? Would, she wondered, more world records be broken if everyone was better informed, if training was smarter?After all, only an athlete at ease with herself and her invisible troubles has the bombast to train and perform like a great. Men and women are very different. Physiologically they're different, they shouldn't train the same, she says.I would say men are keen to learn, but where do they find that information? How do they access it?Some of the coaches said they already change the training to the girls' needs, but they don't really know how or what that looks like.We have a coach who we work with regularly and he would say how one of his athletes would have two days every month where she couldn't compete. It was just accepted. The need for understanding from the coach's perspective is huge and that's the biggest thing that's been highlighted.Bruinvels and Conefrey's app is still in its infancy and so to help with development they have been working closely with Celtic Women's football team. Currently half the Glaswegian team's squad use the app, with the club's sports scientists keeping a close eye on results. It gives the players autonomy, Andrew Wiseman, Celtic Women's athletic development coach, tells CNN Sport. We very much encourage them to take the reins. It makes them more aware of the influence of the cycle on performance. Performance is such a big thing. There are so many factors that can influence it. It certainly has had its benefits for us. We collect data every day. If I was to look back over two or three months of data and can't work out why that person isn't performing, if we can't pinpoint anything, we do now have an alternative and we'll ask that player: can we have a look if you're using the app.Since using the app, Celtic Women's captain Kelly Clark, a trainee accountant, has noticed she has more energy to perform after a day in the office. Before the app, I'd just blame work for everything, she tells CNN Sport. I'd just think to myself 'I've worked hard this week so maybe that's why I feel tired.' I didn't think it could be anything to do with the menstrual cycle. It's reassuring at times to know that that's probably the way I should be feeling. There was one day at work when I drank two liters of water throughout the day, but I was still thirsty. I didn't understand why so I checked the app and it said 'make sure you drink enough water today.' That day it was so on-point that I began to take it more seriously. I've never focused on hydration and nutrition as much as I do now and this season is the fittest I've been. It could be down to the app, it could be down to training, but it's probably a combination of both.Clark admits that menstruation is still a subject the squad rarely talks about, although teammates with history of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries have spoken of the benefits of having an easily accessible reference point. For the players who had done their ACLs, the app reassured them that they could really push themselves in training. It really helped mentally, says the Scot. Because football is a team sport you can't completely change training sessions for one person. But if it's proven that during certain times of the month you need to be more careful, we should all have access to that information. In football especially, there are a lot of male coaches and it's an area they don't want to speak about, but this information has probably forced that upon them.What next for Bruinvels and Conefrey? They have already embarked on the second part of their project, asking more questions to hundreds of women, making plans to update the app to accommodate the fresh information at their disposal.We've lots of plans, Conefrey tells CNN Sport, her eyes widening. This is just our first version of it. It's about sharing information and giving it to a wider audience. We want to build an app that takes everything into account for the female athlete and will then generate its own data. We asked the question whether anyone altered their training and nutrition and the answer was 'no.' Then we asked do they want to and the answer was 'yes.' But if you Google it, there's no information on how to do this. You don't want to go into that quarterfinal thinking 'oh crap, I'm on my period'. I definitely want to change that mindset."},
{"title": "Jean-Pierre Rives: Rugby captain turned steel sculptor, the French icon who found 'something else'", "cate": "sport", "content": "I came to rugby because the door of my school gym was glass, says Jean-Pierre Rives, and I went through it.It was, in many ways, a fitting introduction to the game for a man who never found self-preservation to be a high priority. The image of a bloodied, bandaged Rives -- nicknamed Casque d'Or (Golden Helmet) because of his blonde mop of hair -- is a defining one for those who followed rugby in the 1970s and 80s. Yet it could have been so different had that shy, 13-year-old boy not been hurled through a gym door during a rough, playground game; nor had the teacher on duty not brushed him down and suggested he join the local club rugby team. It was a decisive moment. Rives went on to play for his country 59 times, captaining Les Bleus on 34 occasions. He led France to two grand slam triumphs in 1977 and 1981, and the nation's first ever victory in New Zealand in 1979. Since retiring, he has focused his energy on sculpture, for which he has earned critical acclaim with his work exhibited around the world. It's for his rugby, though, that Rives is best remembered -- a fearless flanker who played the game with a commitment rarely seen before or since. When you're young, you're indestructible, Rives tells CNN in an exclusive interview. You just use your body as a weapon.There were lots of big guys and I wasn't so big, so I had to find something else.And that something else wasn't just unwavering courage; it was also a deep respect for the game and for those playing it. For Rives, rugby has always been more than 30 men and a ball; it is unity, brotherhood, and sacrifice -- a means of expression shaped by those you share it with. The best thing about it was just being with great guys, he says. I have so many friends now and so many memories; we're made of this.Rugby, it's a way of life, it's a spirit, an  -- a state of mind. For me, it is the way I am and I'm still the same because of it. The team Rives captained exemplified French rugby as a whole, playing with  -- a certain style and flair -- that was exuberant, fast-moving, and eye-catching. It's something that many regret the loss of in today's French team with its heavy forward pack and increased focus on percentage rugby. For Rives, he has no doubt it's the way the game should be played. Be they teammates or opponents, he couldn't help but admire rugby's most gifted attackers.  Without freedom, there's no energy, and without energy there's no invention. I love players who can invent something, who can create something extraordinary, who are unpredictable. We talk about French flair, but we didn't really know what it was. I remember when [Serge] Blanco was playing, nobody knew where he was going, and I'm not sure he knew himself. But mostly he was going the right way. When Rives first took up rugby, he would beg with the coach to let him play center, only to be told that he was a great tackler and needed in the forwards -- but next time he could play center.The next time never came. I dreamed all my life of being  or  or so many of the players I admire like . Myself, I just played rugby. Those players, they payed something different.Unfortunately, I didn't have enough talent to play like this, but what a pleasure it was to play at the same time as them. Rives never thought himself a talented player, but his heart-and-soul commitment -- in a test match or on the training ground -- was what set him apart. He would train twice a day, often by himself, and in team sessions led by example. Richard Escot, a long-term writer and correspondent for L'Equipe, singles out France's first ever victory against the All Blacks in New Zealand. France lost the first test and were very upset, says Escot. Jean-Pierre said nothing, apart from, 'okay, we go training.' He was the first in training and he put in so much energy that everybody followed without a word. Not a word, nothing -- they just followed. He wasn't the kind of captain who screamed or shouted, but he's the only one players will follow into the gates of hell. Escot forged a close friendship with Rives after authoring Rugby & Art, a series of conversations between the two men. In his eyes, Rives is France's greatest captain. He says the only player today who's perhaps comparable is Australian superstar David Pocock. Jean-Pierre always put his head where nobody would put their toes, says Escot. He was really out of this world, and would still be tremendous if he was playing now. He'd put his hands on the ball and nobody would be able to move him.If you were under Jean-Pierre Rives' captaincy you should act for others. You should be a good man, an altruist, not thinking about yourself, but thinking about the team and what the French national jersey means to you.It was while watching his friend and mentor Albert F\u00e9raud that Rives was first inspired to become a sculptor after retirement from rugby. Working mainly with huge steel beams gathered from scrap heaps, Rives' creations, which have occupied the past 30 years of his life, have been displayed at notable exhibitions in Paris, Toulouse, Sydney, and New York. His form is abstract -- it's not clear in French, let alone English -- he confesses, but says the impulse to create is what motivates him most, whether the end results please him or not. Sculpture is so important for me, says Rives. To be is to make something, to invent something. When you're making something you're not really looking at it. After a while you pass it again and see it and see something interesting in it, and other times you think, 'My God! What is this?'Rives' interest in rugby remained after retirement through the , a team he co-founded alongside his teammates from the 1977 grand slam-winning side. And it's not to say that, with sculpture, he's lost sight of what he held so dear about rugby. It's the same in lots of ways, rugby and sculpture -- you express yourself through something, says Rives. When you play rugby, you try to express yourself with your body, with your soul. In art, it's something else -- color or form.It's the process that's important to me, not what you're doing; do anything, but do it.For Rives,  is important. He sculpts, he paints, he's a trained classical pianist, but admits he'd rather have played jazz. He speaks enthusiastically about golf -- an incredible sport -- and as a boy qualified for the French Junior Championships at Roland Garros. He discusses with sincerity the important of literature, art, and, above all, friendship. All of this energy, you feel, was put on show when Jean-Pierre Rives took to the rugby field -- a man for whom the sport was always bigger than life itself.  Most people can put rugby into life, says Escot, but he's the only one who could put life into rugby. "},
{"title": "Has the digital age changed football fans?", "cate": "sport", "content": "Sky Ouyang used to avidly follow Real Madrid, keeping up to date with how the La Liga club was doing from his Shanghai home. A Real shirt from the 2008/09 season -- Cristiano Ronaldo's first campaign as a Real player -- was a prized possession. But then Ronaldo moved to Juventus and Ouyang's loyalties changed.Focused flicked from Spain to Italy; to the back of the wardrobe went the Real shirt, in came Juventus merchandise, and immediately it was the Italian club the 23-year-old followed on every social media platform. I support Ronaldo first and foremost. The team isn't important, it's whoever he plays for, the social media executive, who first fell under the Portuguese's spell when Ronaldo was the young buck at Manchester United beguiling with step-overs and swerves, tells CNN Sport. Ouyang is not alone in switching his allegiances to Juventus following Ronaldo's $117m summer transfer from a club with whom he established himself as one of the greatest to have played the beautiful game.Juventus was the fastest growing European club online in China last month, the number of followers ballooning at a rate which has been described as unprecedented. Perhaps it should be of no surprise that five-time Ballon d'Or winner Ronaldo, a footballer who has only one equal in Lionel Messi for comparable talent and fame, attracts such zealous following in a country where success and celebrity is cherished.There hasn't been an incident like this where there's been fans moving from one team to another or deciding to choose and follow a second team. This is probably the largest shift we've ever seen in China, says Tom Elsden, senior client manager at Shanghai-based digital marketing and investment company Mailman.In the same period, Real Madrid have lost followers so there's been a direct correlation between Juventus growing and Real Madrid losing followers.But the tidal wave of followers which came Juventus' way once it signed one of the world's most famous sportsmen was not merely a Chinese phenomenon. The Bianconeri has gained 3.5m Instagram followers over the last month, while Juventus' engagements, impressions and followers on Facebook, Twitter and YouTube have also rocketed.Does Ronaldo's digital influence, his power to change a fan's allegiance, mean the nature of football fandom has changed?If Ronaldo, Neymar and Messi all have a bigger social media following than their clubs, is this the era where the sport's biggest names garner more devotion than the teams for whom they play?Simon Chadwick, professor of sports enterprise at Salford University, says the cult of celebrity has changed the way football fans around the world associate with teams and players. There is the emergence of celebrity culture over the last 15 to 20 years in a way that didn't exist in the 60s, 70s, 80s and 90s, he tells CNN Sport. We're now more interested in celebrities than perhaps we are teams and that's a characteristic of not just football and sport but of life in general.Star footballers have been hero-worshiped since the beginning of the 20th Century and for decades have attempted to capitalize on their popularity.At the peak of his footballing powers in the 1960s, former Manchester United winger George Best -- a man once dubbed the fifth Beatle -- famously appeared in an advert in the United Kingdom telling viewers that Cookstown bangers were But much has changed since those black and white days when one of the world's most celebrated players helped increase sales in sausages for a family butcher.Advertising campaigns are more sophisticated, footballers' brands are carefully cultivated, major clubs and their players are lucrative businesses and, crucially, there is the world wide web. The internet, said Stephen Hawking, has connected us like neurons in a giant brain and has allowed players and clubs to communicate directly with fans, while in this globalized world almost everything is accessible, from live streaming a match to buying snazzy boots. If, as renowned journalist Arthur Hopcraft once wrote, football reflects the kind of community that we are then the sport as it is today, and those who follow it, are a reflection of an interconnected world. There's something in the way in which the social and digital environment has enabled fans to challenge the existing ways of being a fan and perhaps therefore it's breaking down the barriers to fandom that previously existed, says Chadwick.  The role of social media is shaping people's associations and perceptions. For many younger people in particular they have less affiliation with a football team that's embedded in the town where they're from and more association with global icons. Those global icons can be Manchester United or Real Madrid, but at the same time those global icons can be Kylian Mbappe, Ronaldo or Paul Pogba. and blistering forward play helped France win the World Cup in Russia. The 19-year-old, like so many of Generation Z (those born in the '90s and 2000s), hasn't lived in a world without social media.We've not heard much about brand France or the marketing potential of the French national team. What we've heard lots about is the commercial potential of brand Mbappe, says Chadwick. There is a focus on the individual and the marketing of those individuals is consistent with Generation Z and the way Generation Z consumes products and associates with brands.I don't think we understand Generation Z as well as we should right now. Do we know that Generation Z is even interested in football? Aren't they more interested in social media and filming each other? I would stand by my observation that Generation Z is interested in individuals and their point of engagement is around individuals and you see that through the emergence of vloggers and internet celebrities.Then there is portfolio fandom as Chadwick puts it, a reference to fans who will support a number of teams, typically one from each major European league, reflecting the fluid and open way many of us lead our lives.Portfolio fandom has, to a certain extent, existed for decades. Ardent fans of one particular club will often have a soft spot for a team in a different division.The popularity of the football program Football Italia which broadcast Serie A matches live on terrestrial TV in the UK in the 1990s helped make following the Italian top flight hipster cool before the word hipster had entered the popular lexicon. That was also, of course, before the English Premier League spread its tentacles across the globe. Yet even two to three decades ago, the sight of a Barcelona shirt, let alone one with the Catalan club's star player Messi embossed on the back, was rare anywhere outside of the region. These days seeing children playing in, for example, a Barcelona shirt is common in many neighborhoods around the world. The name on the back of that shirt is also often entirely predictable.You hear small anecdotes about kids who might not be Real Madrid fans but they're Cristiano Ronaldo fans, says Michael Calvin, an award-winning English sports journalist and author. The nature of fandom has changed, probably for the worst in terms of social media.Calvin is referring to the rise of Arsenal TV, a channel which has over 820,000 YouTube subscribers and 285,000 Twitter followers, and personifies how the digital age has given fans a platform to voice their opinions, be it for good or bad. I don't feel it's very healthy, adds Calvin. They've got every right to their opinion but it's an uneducated opinion in many cases.The whole phenomenon of fan TV where you get people basically expanding on their prejudices and condemning managers out of hand. I don't think that's a very welcome development.In his latest book The State of Play, Calvin touches on Millwall, a London-based team in the second tier of English football which, like many of its stature, is not internationally supported.Those who follow the Championship club do so because such devotion has been bequeathed from one generation to the next. Michael Avery supports the Lions, as did his father, his grandfather, and as do his two children.  You're born into being a Millwall fan -- you don't think 'I'll start supporting them', Avery tells CNN Sport. You won't necessarily get someone who's 30 years old who's just got into football supporting Millwall.While the club is one promotion away from the riches of the Premier League, Avery says the majority of fans would not want to reach the promised land if it meant sacrificing the club's identity. Millwall prides itself on being a working-class club, a family club. It's never been known for big money transfer, or big wages, he explains. I do feel 95% of the fan base have heritage in the area. With the working clubs it's a birthright. As lovely as it would be to see Millwall make the Premier League, we don't want to sell that identity as a working-class football club just to make it to the top division.This week it was revealed that more than half of clubs in the Premier League could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the 2016-17 season because of the league's bumper broadcast deal.In 2018, Deloitte said the majority of Europe's 20 richest clubs earn no more than a fifth of their income from 'matchday revenues.' Clubs are increasingly targeting a global audience by signing lucrative commercial deals and so it should be of no surprise that the way those teams are being consumed has changed. Ed Barrett is a Manchester United fan living in Germany. He also follows St. Pauli, a Hamburg-based football club in Germany's second tier which has not won any major titles but whose 29,500-capacity ground is almost always full. The anti-establishment club has also developed a global following, with its the skull-and-crossbones symbol proving highly marketable. FC St Pauli has an image that allows them to exploit a market niche. As such, they went on a sponsor laden tour of the key US market during the summer. If that helps us pay the bills without increasing ticket prices or selling the stadium name, then that really doesn't bother me, Barrett tells CNN Sport. Likewise, online content or tours by United to gear towards casual fans in the Far East isn't a huge disadvantage to match-going fans. At worst, a minor irritation if you bother following the club on social media where some of the content seems far removed from the essence of the club.Fandom has as many layers as a trifle. It is also complex. Fans come in many guises and the extent of their devotion varies. Not that the supporters themselves seem too concerned about these developing intricacies. It's a different kind of fan, Millwall's Avery says of the disciples of the global icons.  As much as Ronaldo and Messi are the iconic image, there's obviously an interest in the brand of football. It's just how times have changed.It is the clubs themselves, the global players who have chased new supporters, who are having to adapt the most. The formation of the Premier League helped to instigate a culture change not just in English football, but in world football more generally, says Chadwick.The old days, which we can refer to as pre-1992 before the Premier League, were very conventional. They were much simpler and what that therefore did was create not just one generation of fans but multiple generation of fans. But post-1992, a new generation of citizens and consumers began to emerge and obviously this is being driven by globalization and digitalization and so the world of football fandom is now much more complex that it was 20, 30, 40 years ago. When you begin to factor in Juventus trying to target fans in China through Ronaldo, you're not talking about old Juventus fans and young Juventus fans, but Chinese fans too. What football clubs are faced with is having to understand somewhat the Chinese, Europeans, Americans, Millennials, Generation X, Generation X. There are differences between urban and suburban viewers, men and women.For football clubs, which are relatively small organizations, understanding this complexity is a huge challenge for them."},
{"title": "'Tennis gave me the ability to be somebody': Julie Heldman on depression and bottling up abuse", "cate": "sport", "content": "That Julie Heldman feels well enough within herself even to attend the Indian Wells Masters next week should be seen as sufficient victory for one of women's tennis' original pioneers.That she is willing to tell her story on the eve of a first major public appearance in the tennis world in seven years is all the more remarkable, given the emotional strife and mental illness she has both faced and fought.Heldman enjoyed a hugely successful playing career, winning 22 singles titles in an era awash with some of the women's game's most iconic names -- she can lay claim to victories over Billie Jean King, Margaret Court, Chris Evert, Martina Navratilova and Virginia Wade.Indeed, she sits among the most significant figures in the history of women's tennis. She was one of the Original Nine, the group of female players who would forego the threat of suspension in order to join the Virginia Slims Circuit, which would eventually form the basis of the WTA Tour.It was a rebellion; a revolt against the United States Lawn Tennis Association (USLTA) overseeing a startling inequality between the prize money paid to male and female players. At the 1970 Italian Open, Ilie Nastase received $3,500 for winning the men's title, while King took home just $600 for victory in the women's event.The women's game would change further in 1973, with King's famous Battle of the Sexes victory over Bobby Riggs providing impetus to the burgeoning world of women's professional tennis. However, it remained a tough school for any female athlete.It was very difficult to be taken seriously, Heldman recalls. You have to take into account this inherent prejudice -- that men should be in charge and that the women should be left to do what they do.Each one of us was seen as outcasts. We had muscles at a time when women weren't meant to have muscles; some of us were gay; some of us were trying to do something that women were supposedly not meant to do. We were being attacked so often by the men, so we always had this togetherness -- whether we liked each other or not. There was not one other girl in my high school who competed in sport. What happened back then was like another world. We had to be the trailblazers.There is, though, a rare complexity to Heldman's relationship with tennis -- a sport in which she was once ranked as the world's fifth best player, but also one that saw her at her most troubled.The daughter of Gladys Heldman, an indomitable driving force in the advent of the Virginia Slims tour, hers is a tale of an impossible struggle, centered on the relationship between mother and offspring, emotional abuse and survival amid decades of undiagnosed mental illness.Since the release of Julie's memoir last year, Driven -- a catalogue of strength in adversity, laying bare the details of a deeply complex life has become easier; the placing of pen to paper serving as a catharsis to a lifetime of bottled-up secrets.It is absolutely extraordinary, Heldman reflects of her upcoming return to the tennis world. From the thrill in her voice, it is clear that she means it. Given all that she has faced, in many ways, this is a personal triumph that outweighs much of what the former US No.2 achieved with racket in-hand. It says much for the debilitating power of mental illness that someone who thrived in front of a watching audience -- both as player and then as broadcaster -- has felt so unable to show face.It is always more of a struggle for me when there are a lot of people around, she confesses. The fact that I can even think about going is pretty thrilling.The effects of a childhood of emotional abuse have seen her face a lifetime of difficulty. Long after the end of her playing career, Heldman was diagnosed with bipolar, a disorder that has -- at least -- given context to some of her difficulties.While Gladys played an immense role in putting the building blocks in place for the future of the women's game, her treatment of Julie was cruel. It was motherhood, but without the mothering. Julie would spend the majority of her formative years in isolation, starved of empathy, regularly belittled.At the same time, however, there is an undying pride in what her mother achieved. Gladys, for her faults, had also suffered from a childhood devoid of maternal compassion. In 2003, she would take her own life.She was a fearless woman championing the female cause in what was, almost exclusively, a man's world. Indeed, Gladys would be inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1979 -- some feat for a promoter and publisher; she founded the highly influential World Tennis magazine.One of the reasons I wanted to write the book was to explain this amazing thing, Julie explains. I am completely proud of my mother and all that she did for tennis and all that she achieved.Did she love me? I think the answer is yes. But she was, in many ways, incapable of showing empathy. Emotion was very difficult for her to show. Even though some kind of love was lurking underneath, it was very difficult for her to show it in normal ways.In her memoir, Julie describes her family as possessing all the characteristics of a cult. She writes of 'an exceedingly strong leader; isolation from the rest of the world; control, coercion and abuse by the leader.'It is a cocktail of sentiments that left her with a deep internal conflict. Differentiating my mother from the woman who did so much for women's tennis has been, for many years, close to impossible, she says.In 1970, Julie would attempt suicide. But, nearly half a century later, it is a time in her life that Heldman, now 73, can look back upon without resentment and with a clarity of what was driving her actions.It is important for anyone -- those in sport and not -- to be able to know that if something is going wrong, that there can be help, she says, unprompted, with an experienced wisdom and the self-awareness of someone all too aware of the challenges that come with living with mental illness.Help can be a friend who listens; help can be someone who's trained to give guidance. But if you think you're on your own or if you grow up in an environment where you think that you absolutely have to win, that is going to cause its own damage.To find the place to turn to is really important. What I have seen in sport is that, with all the money and with all the people involved, a person might feel like they are getting lost in the cracks. There is always a place somewhere for competitors to turn to.Of her own experience, she admits that, at her lowest, she lacked any such safe haven. After my attempted suicide, I did not know where to go. The only place I knew to go to was back on the tennis court. Yet, nobody had any idea what I was going through. The fact that nobody knew had a massive impact on me.In many ways, tennis and winning at tennis and being successful was a saving grace because it gave me the ability to be somebody.That's how I would feel when I won. So, tennis became the one thing that I could turn to; but in itself, tennis was also harmful to me.With my mother, if I won she would say that I was the best thing ever, but if I lost I felt terrible. But either way, even if I was the best thing ever, she would often undermine me. It felt like I was living on a razor's edge -- damned if I won and damned if I lost.The real pull of the career was the traveling, with Heldman's status among the world's best seeing her paid to fly to Buenos Aires, South Africa, London and Australia at a time when such a lifestyle was both enviable and uncommon. However, her own personal situation brought with it a pressure that, she says, made life as a professional tennis player difficult to appreciate.I enjoyed hitting a hard forehand, I enjoyed constructing a point well. But I didn't get pure joy out of walking out onto a tennis court, she admits. There was so much wrapped up in tennis, including the fact that my mother dominated the tennis world. She was involved in what I was doing, which felt dangerous to me. People would tell me how wonderful she was, so in some ways, I was stuck in a world where I was almost doubly trapped.Nobody [in tennis] knew and nobody in my family spoke about [the abuse], Heldman recalls. I did not actually have an understanding myself that what I was going through was significant. That was and has remained one of the most difficult things for me -- that feeling that nobody would understand, but then I didn't either.It was, therefore, close to incomprehensible that other people would have considered the way I grew up as being difficult at all. Putting that all together has been the hardest bit.Quite simply, having spent much of her childhood alone, hers was the only upbringing she knew. There was no reason to disbelieve it.The process of beginning to understand, she explains, has been multifaceted. It began with therapy: I cried for three days, she says of being told by her therapist that her childhood experiences had not been normal.It was only a few sessions in that she explained that other families would not have treated me this way. She told me that this didn't have to happen.Perhaps, though, what is most significant in explaining Heldman's lifelong struggle with herself is that she has come to understand her own set of circumstances.Not only can she now comprehend an often tearful and lonely youth, but she has been able to recognize the root of what she describes as her volatility on the court.Heldman pauses as she recalls an anecdote from the recent past. One of the old players said to me: 'I like you more now than I used to', and I began to understand that I could have been jarring and I could have been difficult.That was because I didn't understand what was going on and because I wasn't receiving help a lot of the time. It was hard to be otherwise -- I never wanted to be jarring and difficult.It is a story that summarizes all that bipolar brings -- the episodes of depression that accompany the periods of manic energy.Mania, for me, feels like second nature, Heldman explains. I have always pushed too hard, so I do not know that things are going wrong if I start functioning at a very high level. It hooks into what I do, which is to be driven and to do as much as possible.Depression, on the other hand, is very clear to me. When I start feeling bad, I often stop being able to function -- even to get out of bed or to talk to people on the phone. Using a telephone can feel daunting. There were many years when I had no clue as to why it was happening.It happened sometimes when I was playing on the tennis tour, which was difficult because I couldn't function. The upside can be so startling, but the downside can be terrible.If I can't function, I can't succeed. If I can't succeed, I can't feel good. It has always been that way.Alongside her childhood trauma and the inherent stresses of tournament tennis, she counts her bipolar -- and the harmful effects of her medication -- among the four major culprits of her mental struggle.Yet, Heldman also pinpoints the revelation of her bipolar as another crucial step on her pathway towards comprehending the events of her own existence. My brain chemistry was going in different directions at the same time, Heldman explains. They said I had a dual diagnosis -- both the childhood abuse and the bipolar.With the help of therapy, it was also a diagnosis that has allowed Heldman to put together the pieces of her lifelong jigsaw.I can look back now and see why I went through certain things, she says. I thought about why I used to get upset so often and why I used to think that I didn't have friends. The truth is that I didn't have friends because I didn't know people. I grew up without others.It's why I got upset so often -- something was deeply churning inside of me and it was something that I did not understand. There are a lot of people out there on the tennis tour who have 'stuff' [that drives them]. Mine was my story and what happened to me was severe.With the passing of time, Heldman has found a way to add nuance to the win-at-all-costs mantra that was force-fed into her psyche as a child and that heightened the issues she has faced in adulthood.A cataclysmic breakdown that forced her to retire from the business she co-controlled alongside her husband, Bernie, has also -- paradoxically, perhaps -- played its part.Once that happened, I couldn't do much, she explains. It taught me a lesson in itself -- that I could have a life even though I wasn't achieving, that there was a lot to be joyful for in waking up every day and having a family.Before, I felt great if I won, but I immediately felt lousy because I'd feel like something awful was about to happen. Now, I can sit back and understand that I did some good things. I can finally look at that and realize -- I'm proud of what I did and I'm able to feel that pride now that I feel more at peace.As a captivating chat comes towards its end, Heldman briefly goes silent as she ponders the notion of regret. Could her career and her adult life have followed a different path had she belonged to a different time? Could the modern-day appreciation of mental illness have provided her with a greater and earlier understanding of her own troubles? Could an alternative childhood have led to an even greater tennis career?Her response -- when it comes -- is fascinating. It highlights, perhaps better than any other moment in a truly heartening hour, the value of Heldman's own long-term introspection.It was an era when there wasn't much help, she acknowledges. It is hard to undo the daily indignities of a child. Once it happens every single day of your life, it is hard to think that you could have been a different person.I was that driven child who had to win and who felt better from winning. Had I had a different life, who knows? I wonder whether I would have won so much had I not been so driven."},
{"title": "The match that changed football", "cate": "sport", "content": "There was a time when Barcelona fans did not expect success. To wallow in pessimism was the accepted norm. Trophies? Titles? They were for others, usually the reserve of the grandiose club of the capital, Real Madrid. The European Cup was as elusive as the unicorn: talked about, looked at with wonder, pictured with others but never seen in this Catalonian city by the Mediterranean sea.A club like Barcelona, the nihilistic fans would say, would never reach the zenith of European club football. There was no bombast, no peacocking, just fatalism. The ironhanded years of General Francisco Franco, whose dictatorial regime had crushed Catalonia's earlier limited autonomy, had ruined the spirit. True, Barcelona had been able to sign football greats such as Johan Cruyff and Diego Maradona, but two European Cup finals -- in 1961 and 1986 -- had ended in defeat and between 1961 and 1990, the club won just two league titles in Spain's top flight, finishing runners up 13 times. But all changed on May 20, 1992.That was the day Barcelona won its first European Cup. That was the day the club, its city, and football was transformed.Springtime in London. Cruyff, the football revolutionary, now Barcelona's visionary coach, and his assembled team of artists, known as the Dream Team, are at Wembley for the first European Cup final of the Dutchman's managerial reign. Opponents Sampdoria have poachers supreme in Gianluca Vialli and Roberto Mancini, but Barcelona can offset the Italians with Michael Laudrup, Pep Guardiola, Hirsto Stoichkov and Ronald Koeman. If it's a title-winning team of regal talent, Barcelona's fans, however, are preparing for the worst.Memories of the club's European Cup final defeat on penalties to Steaua Bucharest in 1986 are still fresh so supporters ask Cruyff to record a few soothing words for the return journey to Spain, a precaution should the worst happen.But Cruyff, in his fourth year as Barca manager, wants his players to forget about the club's past. His battle cry as he sends his men out onto the Wembley turf? Go out there and enjoy it. The European Cup was the football holy grail for Barcelona,  -- tells CNN. It was more than a thorn in their side. It was something that was almost mythical, to get to that final and win it.Full-time turns into extra-time and the score remains goalless. Knees are knocking, in the stands and in the dugout. Penalties are looming. Fear. But with less than 10 minutes remaining Barcelona is awarded a free-kick. Koeman, the sweeper with a sniper's eye for long-range goals, steps forward. Watching on television in Barcelona is a teenaged Xavi, an academy player who would go on to become one of the club's greats. It was truly an extraordinary experience, the former Spain and Barcelona midfielder tells CNN as he remembers the match unfolding.Twenty-five yards from goal, Koeman shoots. He aims low towards the bottom corner. Defenders rush forwards, breaking from the defensive wall. The goalkeeper stretches and dives to his right. But they're all too late. They are beaten. The goalscorer sprints towards the sidelines and his teammates follow, swallowing him up in a jubilant wave of orange shirts when he is caught. When the blond Dutchman emerges from the celebratory mass, he is hiding his face in his hands, using his fingertips to hold back tears. His is the winning goal, a strike which unshackles his club from the heavy weight of history. It was the beginning of big changes, Koeman, who pulled on Barca's blue and garnet shirt over his orange top before lifting the European Cup, would later say. Cruyff had made an impact at the Camp Nou as a player, winning the title in his first season following a world-record move in 1973, but it was the Dutchman's appointment as coach in 1988 that changed the club's DNA.On May 4, when Cruyff is announced as Barcelona's coach, the team is experiencing its worst season since 1941-42.  The club is in debt and in crisis.  They go on to finish sixth in the league, two points off 10th place, while Real Madrid celebrate a fifth straight La Liga title. Ignominy. He had, Cruyff said, inherited players who wanted to have fights about the past. In planning for the future a manic period of departures and arrivals follows -- 15 players are sold and 12 are bought. Cruyff, one of the greatest players of all time, took risks but rewards followed. Among the newcomers are the young and eager Txiki Begiristain, Jose Mari Bakero, Julio Salinas and Eusebio Sacristan, a quartet which would become crucial cogs in the manager's Dream Team. They were conditioned to coming second, says Hunter of the Barcelona squad Cruyff inherited. He felt there was a losing mentality around Catalonia itself and that this was a product of years of oppression under the Franco dictatorship. Commenting on another tragic day had become a habit.To accompany the change of personnel, came a shift in style. Naturally, Cruyff -- a three-time European Cup winner with Ajax -- wanted to win, but there was a way of winning. A philosophy, an identity. In the era of 4-4-2, the young manager introduced the 3-4-3 formation -- an adaptation of the 4-3-3 system Cruyff had played under the coaching pioneer Rinus Michels for the Netherlands and Ajax in the 1970s. We couldn't believe how many attackers were in the team, Eusebio, who made more than 250 appearances under Cruyff, said of the day the boss first drew three defenders, four midfielders, two out-and-out wingers and a center-forward on the blackboard. This radical change would require players to be comfortable interchanging positions. They would have to press, they would have to pass swiftly. Possession would reign supreme, which was not an easy task in a club where defenders were usually jeered for passing the ball back to the goalkeeper. For Cruyff to implement this cerebral approach, he needed a production line to supply him with possession-hungry players. Cue the overhauling of La Masia, the club's academy. Barcelona would never be the same again. Every team, from the under-eights to Barcelona's B team, were ordered to play the revolutionary 3-4-3, with an emphasis on technique rather than physique, another volte-face for a club which, as recently as 1986, selected young players based on whether they would be taller than 1.80m. First off the conveyor belt were Albert Ferrer, Guillermo Amor and Guardiola, the 1992 history-makers.For Carlos Hugo Garcia Bayon, a former assistant coach at Barcelona B, winning the European Cup with academy graduates in the side was confirmation that Cruyff's methods worked. Bayon tells CNN: It was that victory which changed the culture and mentality of the club. They won the European Cup, but won it playing a specific style and with a lot of players from La Masia. It was something unique, something that differentiated us from others. Without a doubt, if you have a methodology and that methodology doesn't win, you are going to lose confidence to play players from the academy.From that famous Wembley win, other world class seedlings blossomed at the La Masia hothouse: Xavi, Lionel Messi, Andres Iniesta, Carles Puyol, Gerard Pique, Cesc Fabregas, to name but a few.All of them, bar Messi, integral to not only Barcelona's success but that of the Spain team which won the World Cup in 2010 and two consecutive European Championships in 2008 and 2012. They were the generation who paved the way for us, says Xavi of the European Cup-winning Dream Team. They gave Barcelona a winning mentality. It was an example for all of us. Hunter says academy players grew up thinking anything was possible after seeing the likes of Guardiola succeed on the biggest stage of all.  The brand of football we saw from 2003-12, the unbroken stretch of success, those types of players, the promotion from the youth system, the attitude, the winning mentality, all of these have geneses in the Wembley victory over Sampdoria, he says.From Wembley to Barcelona and a dizzying week of celebrations for the club's European pioneers.On the balcony of Placa de Sant Jaume, stood Cruyff's men, soaking up the adulation of their fans, holding aloft the European Cup. Fantasy had become reality. A 21-year-old Guardiola, the Catalan symbol, shouted: Citizens of Catalonia -- now you have it here. The midfielder, says Hunter, had prepared in advance, modifying a phrase used by Josep Tarradellas, named President in absentia by his people in 1954 during the Franco dictatorship, when on the same balcony in the city's gothic quarter 15 years earlier. The Dream Team's European success, combined with the Olympic Games which was held in the city later that summer, transformed Barcelona and its people. Hunter describes the summer of 92 as the one of the most important summers in the history of Barcelona and Catalonia. The football club, whose slogan is 'more than a club' for its defense of the Catalan culture and language, became Catalonia's most important institution. The radical shift was not solely on the pitch. November 25, 2012, the day the teachings of Cruyff, his vision for a team full of La Masia pass masters becomes reality. Barcelona is playing Levante in a league game. In the 14th minute Martin Montoya replaces Brazilian full-back Dani Alves. It is the first time in Barcelona's history that the entire first team comprises of players who graduated through the club's now famed academy. It is the legacy of Cruyff and the 1992 European Cup win. La Masia is a football school but also a school of values, a school of life, explains Xavi.It is something to feel proud about. We now have 20 to 25 years of harvesting titles for Barcelona and playing an attractive style of football for the fans.Guardiola, the great player who became the club's most successful coach, has often said that he and other Barcelona managers have simply been restoring, or improving, the chapel that Cruyff painted. The Catalan himself created a football masterpiece, winning 14 trophies in four golden seasons between 2008 and 2012 with one of the greatest teams in history, the heart of which were other wordly academy talents. For Bayon, currently academy director at Celta Vigo, the transformation of the Dream Team from playing greats to high-class managers is another lasting legacy of that 1992 win, with Cruyff's former players spreading his gospel in various leagues around the world. In England there is Guardiola at Manchester City and Koeman at Everton, while Eusebio is in La Liga. The latter two are being linked with succeeding Luis Enrique as Barca boss when he leaves at the end of this season. There are others too: Michael Laudrup managing in Qatar, Txiki Begiristain, an unused substitute at Wembley, as sporting director at Manchester City and Andoni Zubizarreta in Marseille as the French club's sporting director.  They have become great managers, that's one of the most important thing from that victory. It generated a culture of coaching. It is not only to generate great players, but great coaches, says Bayon. And so, to the future. What about the Barcelona of today?Under Enrique, who will depart at the end of the season having won the Champions League and two Spanish titles, does the legacy of Wembley 1992 still run through the side like letters in a stick of rock? Of the title-chasing Barcelona team which started in the 4-1 victory over Las Palmas on May 14, only four players -- Sergio Busquets, Messi, Iniesta and Jordi Alba -- had played for the academy. Alba, released by the club in 2005, was repatriated seven years later at a cost of 14 million euros ($15.49m) from Valencia. Possession has not always been king for Enrique's Barcelona, although there have been significant departures during the Spaniard's reign. Aged 35, Xavi left in 2015 to play in Qatar, following another academy great, Carles Puyol, who retired in 2014, out of the Camp Nou. No youth system will be able to produce that generation repeatedly on demand, says Hunter. It's just not feasible, but the tail-off has been pretty dramatic and has inevitably changed the football Barcelona play. When you sign from outside they don't have the same aptitude, they don't speak the same football language. There are fewer youth products available to Enrique than there were to (Frank) Riijkard and Guardiola and it's also been a strategic idea that the front three -- Messi, Neymar and Luis Suarez -- need to be given the ball more quickly and with less elaboration because they're different strikers to any in the club's history. They need less work, they're able to score on their own so the midfield is sometimes bypassed.The identity of the first-team football in the last two-and-a-half years has significantly changed, but the actual existence of the youth system in unchallenged, it's part of their identity.Is this the closing chapter of a glorious Cruyff-inspired quarter of a century of success? Not quite. In Xavi, Pique, Busquets and Puyol, Barcelona could have former pupils as zealous off the pitch for their brilliance on it. Xavi has already said he dreams of one day managing his former club and has divulged a plan which would have the club run exclusively by former La Masia graduates, with Pique as president, Puyol as sporting director and Busquets as his assistant. If we talk in 10 years' time, I imagine some president will have attempted, and succeed, in appointing Xavi as first-team coach, with Busquets as his assistant, says Hunter. It's Pique's declared intent to run for presidency at one stage of his life. That would be the most dramatic induction of Cruyff and Guardiola values into the club.How different would Barcelona's history be had they not won in 1992? The trophy cabinet tells a story: Three league titles in the 25 years leading up to the Dream Team's European Cup success, 13 thereafter and four nights of Champions League glory -- a total of 44 trophies in 25 years and their status as one of the sport's dominant forces fixed. Pessimism replaced with confidence, fatalism defeated, and the club's global status only reinforced by the style -- dubbed tiki-taka -- that accompanied that success.Had Barcelona not won in 1992, they may have had greater motivation, Hunter argues, in the 1994 Champions League final against AC Milan, which they lost 4-0. They were complacent, they believed they would win for sure, he says. But without European success under Cruyff there is less glue to hold his system in place. You can't say whether they would have won other Champions Leagues because each of the Champions Leagues subsequently won after 1992 have direct lineage to Cruyff and his beliefs, says Hunter. With no trophy under Cruyff then Barcelona's history is subsequently going to be much poorer and the trophy cabinet is going to be more barren. No European Cup win under Cruyff and the subsequent history, which we've become so used to -- the signing of Messi, the recruitment of Iniesta -- probably wouldn't have happened."},
{"title": "Why the way you accept praise at work matters", "cate": "business", "content": "Almost all employees crave feedback. But when the accolades start rolling in, many get embarrassed, sink into their seat, look away or even try to negate or reject the compliment. But it's important not to do that. How employees receive and acknowledge praise and positive feedback can impact work relationships and career growth. Giving and receiving feedback is one of the most essential skills for creating trust and meaningful relationships at work, but it's one of the hardest things we as human beings have to tackle, said Rebecca Aced-Molina, a certified coach and leadership coach. The key to accepting praise at work is to show you received it and appreciate it. A simple response of thank you very much, I appreciate you saying that or thank you, I worked very hard on it can suffice. If there were other people who were instrumental in the success, you should mention their assistance as well. And don't forget about your body language when receiving the compliment. Be sure to sit up straight and make eye contact.Of course, for some people, this is easier said than done. A lot oftimeswe simply have been mistaught what modesty or humility really is, and it doesn't have anything to do with receiving positive feedback or a compliment, said Denise Dudley, a behavioral psychologist. Rejecting a compliment it's not humility.When you are on the receiving end of someone praising your work, it's expected and beneficial to recognize it. It's not good formto reject something someone gave us, it's better to say thank you and receive it graciously, said Dudley.If your boss gives your hard work a shout-out in a meeting, it's still important to say thank you.It's always a good idea to give credit to coworkers who helped you meet the goal or make a project a success, but keep it quick and simple and don't overtake the meeting. Try saying something like: Thank you very much, I know my team and I worked very hard on the project, suggested Dudley.Many people aren't comfortable accepting feedback, and will brush off praise by saying something like, oh, it wasn't anything special.When you reject or downplay a compliment on something you worked hard on, you are setting the tone of how someone might view your work. They might believe what you say if you tell them it wasn't a big deal, and cease to give you so much credit, which you deserve if you did the work, said Beverly Jones, author of Think Like an Entrepreneur, Act Like a CEO.When you don't take the recognition of your efforts it could also impact career growth, including promotions and pay raises. When you don't acknowledge the positive feedback you have been given, it will contribute unconsciously to the narrative that you aren't as capable as you might really be, said Aced-Molina.It's also important not to interrupt or change the topic -- even if you are a little uncomfortable. Women are far less good than men are at receiving compliments, said Dudley. We tend to deflect or interrupt a lot quicker. When youhavereceived a compliment graciously, it shows you are comfortable and confident with who you are, she added.Receiving compliments well is a characteristic of a good leader.Feedback, both negative and positive, should be a frequent occurrence in the workplace. It can give employee's clarity, increase productivity and morale and help to avoid any tension or confusion. Managers should also note how employees react to and prefer to receivefeedback. Some employees enjoy getting accolades in a big group setting, while others want to hear in a more intimate one-on-one or small group setting. Some people really don't want the spotlight turned on them, even if it's for good reasons, said Dudley. "},

Navratilova wrote: I know I don't have all the answers. I don't think there is a definitive answer here. That is why I want a debate, a conversation that includes everyone and is based, as I have said, not on feeling or emotion but science, objectivity and the best interests of women's sport as a whole.Needless to say, I have always and will always be a champion of democracy, equal rights, human rights and full protection under the law for everyone. When I talk about sports and rules that must be fair, I am not trying to exclude trans people from living a full, healthy life. And I am certainly not advocating violence against trans people, as has been suggested. All I am trying to do is to make sure girls and women who were born female are competing on as level a playing field as possible within their sport.The 18-time Grand Slam champion wrote in The Sunday Times  that it was insane and cheating that hundreds of athletes who have changed gender by declaration and limited hormone treatment have already achieved honors as women that were beyond their capabilities as men.Those comments were labeled transphobic by trans rights group Trans Actual, which tweeted at the time: If trans women had an advantage in sport, why aren't trans women winning gold medals left, right & center?According to current rules issued by the International Olympic Committee in 2016, trans men are allowed to compete without restriction.Trans women, however, must show that their testosterone level has been below a certain level for at least 12 months before their first competition.Navratilova has long spoken out for gay athletes and suffered abuse when she came out while she was still playing professional tennis.Her comments on transgender athletes saw Athlete Ally, a US-based organization that speaks up for LGBT athletes, with the tennis star.However, former swimmer Davies  the BBC Saturday that trans athletes should not be allowed to compete in female competitions to protect women's sport.It is not a transphobic thing - I really want to say we have no issue with people who are transgender, Davies said.Every single woman athlete I've spoken to, and I have spoken to many, all of my friends in international sports, understand and feel the same way as me, she added.We need to come up with something that works for everybody and everybody agrees with, rather than having all sorts of diverse rules.We need to come up with a unified set of rules that is clear, concise and fair.Davies' comments followed a Tweet  Friday where she stated she believes there is a fundamental difference between the binary sex you are born with and the gender you may identify as.To protect women's sport, those with a male sex advantage should not be able to compete in women's sport, she wrote.Rachel McKinnon, the first transgender woman to win a world track cycling title responded by stating Davies was a transphobe.There is no debate to be had over whether trans women athletes have an unfair advantage: it's clear that they don't, she  in a Tweet.Since the Nov 2003 IOC policy openly allowing trans women to compete, not a single trans athlete has even qualified for the Olympics, let alone won a medal.This remains true even after the Nov 2015 IOC policy making it easier for trans women to compete. No trans woman has won an elite world championship medal. The fear that trans women will suddenly 'take over' sport is irrational, which is the very definition of transphobia, McKinnon added."},
{"title": "Interval training and Group classes: The top fitness trends for 2018", "cate": "health", "content": "High-intensity interval training will be the No. 1 fitness trend in the coming year, while smartphone exercise apps that prompt your activities will be out -- or so says the . Such training, known as HIIT, typically involves short bursts of high-intensity exercise followed by a short period of rest or recovery: intermittently sprinting for 30 seconds, for example, during a moderate-pace jog.The US  recommend 150 minutes of moderate activity or 75 minutes of vigorous activity each week with additional muscle-strengthening exercise for adults and 60 minutes a day for children, noted Walter R. Thompson, author of the report and prtesident of the American College of Sports Medicine. So if you step it up a little bit and get your heart rate up and move from, say, walking to jogging, it decreases to 75 minutes per week.HIIT is a worthy way to meet your physical activity guidelines, he said. But there's a word of caution with that: Anytime you do high-intensity anything, there may be an increased risk of injury. If you doubt your ability to safely exercise in high-intensity bursts, Thompson recommends that you get a good physical exam before starting a program.Over the past 12 years, the editors of the American College of Sports Medicine's  have circulated an electronic survey to thousands of professionals, including personal trainers and physical therapists, to predict the biggest health and fitness trends for the coming year. This year's survey, which included responses from 4,133 fitness professionals around the globe, placed group training -- classes involving more than five participants -- in the No. 2 slot. Meanwhile, wearable technology -- such as activity trackers and smartwatches -- came in third, and body weight training -- the use of your own body weight as a form of resistance while doing modified pushups and other exercises -- came in fourth. Strength training, or the use of barbells and weights, placed fifth.  Thompson said the survey was developed for two purposes, the first being to help guide the fitness industry. Although most of the industry is commercial properties, the survey is also helpful to community-based organizations, corporate wellness programs and medical fitness centers.They need some direction as to what will be the next trend in the industry so that when they use their valuable resources for something, they know it's going to work, Thompson said. We also do it from the perspective of people who use the gym, the clients, he said. It helps them identify gyms across the country that are offering the best kinds of exercise programs.Three new trends found a place on the top 20 list: licensure for fitness professionals, core training and sport-specific Training. Licensure refers to the general trend toward more regulation of fitness professionals, such as personal trainers. Core work stresses strength and conditioning of the stabilizing muscles of the abdomen, thorax and back. Sport-specific exercising is usually geared toward younger athletes and focuses on a single sport, such as tennis or boxing.Meanwhile, work-site health promotion (which ranked 16th in last year's survey) and outcomes measures (previously 18th) fell from the top 20 list. In other words, incentive programs in employer-based health care benefits plans and comparison measurements to improve performance are no longer fashionable among the gym set.One of the biggest surprises on the 2018 list was the re-emergence of group exercise programs, said Thompson, who remembers back in the day when that was all we did. Personal training, which was introduced around 2000, reduced the popularity of group training, he noted.  However, after the recession, less expensive group training sessions re-emerged and apparently continue to thrive. It's got to help increase revenue and decrease expenses, Thompson said.Another trend for 2018 will be older adults being welcomed back into fitness clubs. Most gyms still see their greatest revenue source as the 25- to 35-year-old age bracket, Thompson said. But the really smart clubs are changing music and lighting during slower times when the typical gym-goer is at work, so that now, the 60-year-old feels comfortable going into the gym, he said. It makes total sense. Finally, yoga remains in the top 10, where it has been since the survey started, Thompson said. Yoga keeps reinventing itself."},
{"title": "Open and unfussy, this glass chalet is a skier's dream", "cate": "business", "content": "Any place with a warm fire is a welcome respite after a day on the slopes. But for those with modern taste, the typical ski house \u2014 with its chunky lines and a lot of dark wood \u2014 can feel closed-in. Architect Jeremy Jih set out to design a ski house that brought the outside in, without the cold. His modern glass-walled chalet in Stowe, Vermont, offers a cinematic view of the slopes and creates an open and unfussy space that still feels cozy. The 5,000 square-foot, five-bedroom ski home is owned by Jih's partner Jeff Merselis, a health care executive based in Boston.A lot of traditional ski houses are log-cabin-like with lots of dark wood and heavy, big furniture, says Merselis. I wanted something much more light. There is nothing inside the house that competes with the amazing views outside. For Merselis, who bought the house for $420,000 and spent $1.2 million rebuilding it, the main goal was to make the house modern but warm, and to keep the view front and center.We wanted it to be a beautiful modern cabin that would be this spectacular view framed by wood and stone, says Jih.The couple, who began dating just before Merselis bought the house, focused on the exterior and chose glass that was well insulated and efficient.Jih designed the roof lines so that the overhanging eaves would block direct sunlight in the summer, but in the winter, when the sun is lower in the sky, would allow the rays to strike the polished black concrete floor directly, warming it up and allowing for more efficient, passive heating. This is in addition to a radiant heat floor.The first thing many people assume is that it will be drafty and expensive to heat, says Jih, but the heating bill amounts to about $300 a month for a 5,000 square-foot house.Merselis had been searching for a ski house in the Stowe area for nearly a decade. The existing house he bought \u2014 a 1978 home Jih described as Austrian chalet comes to the American suburbs \u2014 was in disrepair. The pipes had burst, resulting in mold, among other maladies.But there were possibilities. When Merselis came to look at it, he was delighted to find that overgrowth was obstructing what he knew to be an incredible view of Mount Mansfield, the highest mountain in Vermont.It was the bones of the house \u2014 and specifically its stones \u2014 that got Jih's attention, though. I immediately told him that he had to buy this one, Jih says. Mostly because of this beautiful, bluestone, three-sided hearth that we rebuilt the house around.The hearth, which is 13-feet high and 10-feet wide on each side, stayed, and the house was rebuilt from the ground up on the three-winged footprint. Six sides feature double-insulated commercial-grade curtain-wall glass in the common areas. The other sides have ample windows, with vertical, 1/8th-inch thick, aluminum louvers on the exterior to provide privacy for the bedrooms. Jih incorporated a trefoil, or clover-shaped path, around the hearth, with the house's wings extending toward three different landscapes: jutting out over the mountain, into an orchard, and overlooking a swimming pool.Jih had skied exactly once when he was commissioned to design the house. But Merselis was skiing before he could walk. I wanted it to be a ski house that wasn't fussy, would accommodate large groups of people, was really low-maintenance, a place that would handle skiers and dogs and muddy hiking boots.Having direct access from the garage into a ski locker area was important because there's so much gear you want to keep together and you don't want to track snow and mud throughout the house, says Merselis.Jih built five side-lit sapele and brass ski lockers with a place for boots, a shelf for gloves, a hook for a coat, space for skis and a top shelf for a hat or helmet.  They also intentionally placed a bigger space priority on the common areas. There's much larger public spaces in the house, which I think is important for a ski house as well, so people can congregate in the kitchen and living room area, but have their private times in the bedrooms, which tend to be much smaller spaces.One of the most notable design features is the sauna. The glass-enclosed sauna has a view of a sculpted block of acrylic etched with a map of the ski trails on Mount Mansfield. Each grid junction on the map doubles as an opening to rack a bottle of wine.The idea was that after you come back from a day of skiing, you want to warm up in the sauna, look at the trails that you've just skied, and pick out a bottle of wine for dinner, says Jih.

{"title": "Global 'goo-goo': What baby talk sounds like around the world", "cate": "health", "content": "We all use baby talk when we babble with bundles of joy, but does how we talk to infants vary across cultures? The answer seems to be yes and no.Some cultures talk more or less to babies, some not at all, said Mark VanDam, assistant professor of speech and hearing sciences in the Elson S. Floyd College of Medicine at Washington State University.Overall, however, the impulse and act of infant-directed speech seems to be pretty human, not necessarily culturally defined, he said. Here is a sampling of how moms and dads from around the world use infant-directed speech or baby talk, and why.Mothers around the world consistently alter their voices when talking to their babies, no matter what language they speak, according to a study published in October in the journal .Researchers recorded and analyzed the voices of 24 moms with a powerful machine-learning algorithm. Half of the women were English speakers, and the others spoke Spanish, Russian, Polish, Hungarian, German, French, Hebrew, Mandarin and Cantonese. Despite their native languages, the study showed, all of the women consistently shifted their timbre -- or the tone and sound of their voice -- when interacting with their infants. The researchers were surprised that this shift in sound was a consistent pattern across such a diverse range of languages, said Elise Piazza, associate research scholar at Princeton University and lead author of the study.After we controlled for pitch, we still found timbre differences between infant-directed speech and adult-directed speech, Piazza said.Though some similarities have been seen in how mothers speak to babies, studies have also spotted some cultural differences among both moms and dads.A study published in February in the journal  found that dads in North America tended to slow their speech when talking to infants, whereas dads in the Pacific island nation of Vanuatu did not. Rather, they tended to shift their pitch more.Researchers examined 30 interactions between the fathers and their infants, around 7.8 months old. More research is needed in a larger sample of fathers to determine that such differences do, indeed, exist in how these dads baby talk.These are small samples, said Greg Bryant, a cognitive scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles. He conducted the study with Tanya Broesch, assistant professor in the department of psychology at .The bigger picture is that there are many ways that mothers and fathers can achieve the same communicative effect, he said. What's universal is that parents often do change their voice when speaking to young children, but how they change exactly could vary across cultures.As for mothers, a study published last year in the journal  found a tendency for Lebanese mothers to use more infant-directed speech than American moms.The study involved 19 American and 19 Lebanese mothers. The researchers recorded audio of the American moms interacting with their infants in a lab and the Lebanese moms interacting with their infants at home.The key difference between the groups was that Lebanese moms had a higher rate in utterances per minute of baby talk than the American moms, the researchers found.Although other research groups have identified differences in baby talk across cultural contexts, this study was the first to report quantitatively on such language differences, the researchers wrote.Still, the study had some limitations. For instance, American moms were tested in a lab, but Lebanese mothers were tested at home, which could explain the differences.On the other hand, it turns out that how babies respond to their parents could vary by culture.Babies will often babble with their native sound-sequences, VanDam said.For example, we don't have words in English that begin with 'tl,' such as 'tlick,' and English-speaking babies don't tend to babble that way, he said, but some Spanish words begin with tl.\u00a0 We also see sign language babies babbling in sign language, which is fairly strong evidence that it's more of a human trait than some language or culture specific trait, VanDam said.In other words, as kids develop, their babbling starts to reflect the speech patterns of their native language, Bryant said.A study published in the  in Novembersuggested that infants start understanding words around 6 months old.So mothers and fathers exaggerate vowel categories, for example, so they'll make vowel sounds a little more noticeable, and then that helps the infants acquire the vowel sounds of their language, he said. Some people also think that exaggerated features in infant-directed speech help kids learn how to parse the\u00a0syntax of spoken sentences, but that is a little more controversial, he said.The changes we tend to make in our voices -- such as exaggerated, repetitive and high-pitched baby talk -- could actually be useful for babies' learning, Piazza said.Previous experiments have shown that infants segment words and learn the meaning of novel words better from infant-directed than adult-directed speech, Piazza said. It also seems to help parents capture babies' attention and engage them emotionally, she said. Adults are generally motivated to engage infants, and they intuitively know that babies respond well to the exaggerated patterns in baby talk. Infant-directed speech is just one example of tailoring your communication style to a particular audience, which we do all the time.Some scientists argue that baby talk not only helps infants acquire language, it helps\u00a0parents form a positive emotional bond with their babies, said Linda Polka, a professor in the School of Communication Sciences and Disorders at McGill University in Canada.Other studies suggest that infants prefer high-pitched infant-directed speech and even infant-directed singing, Polka said. The reason for this preference remains complex, but research suggests that when adults shift the sound of their voices for baby talk, that causes them to sound smaller -- as if their voice is coming from a smaller vocal tract, Polka said.Our research shows that babies prefer to listen\u00a0to speech coming from a smaller infant talker, but we don't know exactly why babies show this preference. Do they simply have a general 'smaller talkers are better' bias, or are they particularly sensitive to how big an infant is? Polka said.In the future, we could figure this out by assessing how they respond to speech sounds that come from a vocal tract that is too small to be an infant. Would they still like it, or would that be less interesting to them? she said.Additionally, Polka said that whether you are talking to a baby or an adult, research suggests that there is a tendency to shift your speech to sound more like the person who you are interacting with.You are more likely to do that when you have a positive regard for the person you're interacting with, Polka said.Adjusting our speech to sound smaller when we use baby talk may be a way to convey affect to the baby, by trying to sound like them, she said. At the same time, it can also help them in terms of their own learning, because we're giving them a chance to listen\u00a0to a voice that sounds more like them. We may be kind of priming them for their own voice, which is quite distinct from an adult voice."},

Plenty of those I heard from spent years blaming themselves and few, if they knew who their attackers were, reported anything to authorities or other adults, including parents. Those who did learned quickly why . They weren't believed, felt ashamed and didn't see justice served. They were fed the boys will be boys line, even by their mothers.  Some had never shared their stories before; others only with select family members or friends.There were those who were relatively unscathed by their experiences. Others were not so fortunate and have years of therapy behind them to prove it. One woman said she dropped out of college for a year and couldn't have an intimate relationship for eight years after her rape. The one who lost her virginity against her will at 15 listed off a series of subsequent assaults and spent much of her adult life struggling with low self-esteem and trying not to feel like a slut. The last time she was assaulted, she was nearly 40. She was walking through a park in broad daylight when a man approached from behind, thrust his hand up her skirt and grabbed her crotch.At first I froze, but then I started to scream, she said. I couldn't stop screaming. ... It was every scream I never screamed. They were assaulted by men or boys they didn't know, and ones they were fixed up with, knew since childhood or were dating. One woman's attacker was a longtime crush; a second's a best friend. A third woman's attacker was a graduate student she looked up to as an undergrad; he was the golden boy in the academic department who could make or break her professional future. A fourth's supervised summer legislative interns on Capitol Hill.A fifth woman revealed she was assaulted by three men -- relatives or people connected to family members.Until their parents die, until they move away and I never have to see their face again, until I die -- most will never know that these people who walk among us have this fundamentally broken way of treating women, she wrote in a social media post.  To come forward about these men before then wouldn't be worth the headache, she said. But, if any of these people got anywhere near one of the highest offices in the land, I'd air their dirty laundry. ... Bless this woman (referring to Christine Blasey Ford) as she walks through this fire. I'm frankly relieved that I likely won't ever be in her shoes.For some, this moment has been triggering. One woman called it a bookend to Brock Turner, a story that hit a number of the women I heard from harder than this. Turner is the former Stanford University student who, in January 2015, was caught on campus, outside a fraternity,  behind a dumpster. He was sentenced to six months in jail but only served three. One woman said the election of President Donald Trump was what did her in. She couldn't stop crying and was inconsolable the day after he won. I felt like my country had just said that a man who was known to be a serial sexual assaulter was worthy to hold the highest office, which meant that it was okay to assault women, she wrote.The growing activism of women give many of them hope, even if they fear that what they want to see will take time.  The ground beneath these men has shifted in ways that they are still not prepared for, one woman said. They want to think, though, that high schoolers and college students are more sensitive and aware, better equipped to call sexual assault what it is and more inclined to speak up. They're afraid they may not be right.If they could talk to their younger selves, they'd take them by the shoulders and tell them they didn't deserve the wrongs pushed on them.Their own parents didn't talk to them in ways they talk to their own children. Their little ones, sons and daughters, learn about consent early and aren't required to hug or touch anyone they don't want to hug or touch. They're given lessons in boundaries and understand they have agency over their own bodies. Some have told their older kids what happened to them, while others say the details are something they'll never share. They don't shy away from using words such as rape and assault. They talk openly about relationships and how to honor partners. They insist their sons treat girls and women -- really, everyone -- with respect and tell their daughters to be vigilant. One woman is waiting for the day when her kids will let her sign them up for self-defense classes.They question if they'd come forward like Kavanaugh's accusers.There are those who can't fathom putting their own lives under the microscope or exposing their families to the fallout. Some look back and, even after all these years, worry that they were partially to blame. One said she'd want to dig into her attacker's more recent past, see if he's shown respect for women and allow for the chance that he'd changed. Others want to believe that if the greater good depended on it, they'd be as brave.The more 'the public' sees that this happened to countless women who did not report it, the harder it will be to deny the accusations of those who do come forward, one woman wrote in an email. We can't all be liars.A few women mentioned that they've Googled the men who assaulted them. They've monitored their lives and careers. One woman decided, timed with the 30th anniversary of her assault, to send the now-family man a letter. She never expected to hear from him -- and she didn't. She did it for herself. By putting words to what she's lived with all these years, she felt better.At one point the prom date who once vowed he was waiting until marriage to have sex, and then paid for an abortion after he raped his date, held a job in a state attorney's office. I remember back then wondering what I would do if I learned he was running for public office. It seemed plausible that he would, the woman said. I wondered if he considered me and my abortion a skeleton in his Republican closet.Just days after she first typed #MeToo on her Facebook page last year, even though they had no friends in common, he sent her a Facebook friend request. It was the first contact he'd made with her since he'd written 35 years earlier to tell her she was going to hell. It felt a bit like a litmus test, she said. Would her accepting, in his mind, mean he was safe?She waited a few days and then accepted. She did it not because she was letting him off the hook. She accepted because she wanted him to see her every post, to know how strong she is. "},
{"title": "Christmas comes early for toddler with terminal cancer", "cate": "health", "content": "Jingle Bells played on radios across Ohio. The local mall plastered Merry Christmas on its digital signs. And hundreds of people, in 90-degree weather, wore Santa hats as they caroled in front of one little boy's home. It's only September, but for a 2-year-old with terminal brain cancer, Christmas came early this year.Colerain Township, a suburb of Cincinnati, celebrated the holiday this weekend because doctors say the boy, Brody Allen, wouldn't make it to December. Despite aggressive and painful chemotherapy, brain scans showed that Brody's five embryonal tumors were not responding to treatment. The doctor had tears in his eyes as he was telling us, said his aunt, Dina Brock. The poor boy had gone through so much in the hospital, but there wasn't any good news.After Brody spent more than 90 days at Cincinnati Children's Hospital, much of it in the intensive care unit, the Allen family decided to bring him home. Painful radiation therapy would do little for his prognosis, doctors told the family, and we wanted to do everything we could to let him live life, said Brock.He can't use the left side of his body, his speech has changed, and he has tremors, she said. But back at home, he doesn't get down about it. He doesn't know what we know. He doesn't know he has cancer.The family started a Facebook group, , to update loved ones on his status. Hoping to celebrate the holidays one last time with their son, the family made a post asking friends and family for Christmas lights.That small request went viral, and more than 13,000 people have since joined the group, sending prayers from as far away as London and Paris. The love and attention they're giving Brody is unbelievable, said Brock. People are reaching out for no other reason than their good will.Back at home, Brody's neighborhood soon turned into a winter wonderland. Inflatable snowmen lined the streets and garland hung from fences and front doors. Brody was the Grand Marshal of his own superhero-themed Christmas parade, which featured Santa riding a firetruck, cheerleaders and a dazzling fireworks display this past Sunday.When the parade started, my family was in the front row to see it all, said Amanda Hill, a Colerain Township resident who watched with her husband and twin children. It was overwhelming and abundantly clear how much that little boy meant to the community.In divisive times, Brody's story has brought family, friends and even strangers together.This is a community of people with diverse backgrounds, beliefs, ethnicities and genders coming together for Brody, said Matt Castleman, a pastor at the Crossroads West Side church outside of Cincinnati. Castleman, who studied musical theater, worked with local radio station WARM 98.5 to organize a flash mob on Saturday outside of Brody's home.The Children's Theatre of Cincinnati provided reindeer and elf costumes, Castleman's church helped turn out singers, and the station took photos. Volunteers handed out lyric sheets at a local grocery store before consolidating cars and heading to Brody's neighborhood, where they distributed gifts and sang songs like Silent Night while holding hands.The Allen family knew that we were coming, but they were shocked when we showed up with hundreds of people, Castleman said. It was so hot, he added, that you couldn't tell if people were crying or sweating. The airwaves were blanketed with the holiday spirit, too. We decided to play one Christmas song per hour with a shout out to Brody before every song, to help him celebrate with his family a little early, said Brian Demay, the program director at WARM 98.5.That support has meant the world to Brody, an outgoing boy who spent months in the ICU, where he often wasn't allowed to see his brothers or sisters. He definitely seems happier to me, said Brock. He loves people and he's not afraid of anyone. He's a flirt, she added. He's a major flirt. He's flirting with any and everybody, but mostly the ladies. And he has fans, too. Supporters have been using the hashtag #TeamBrody to send support to members of the Allen family, who have already raised more than $37,000 through a  created to cover Brody's medical expenses. The boy's father, Todd Allen, wrote on Facebook that the world collectively has reached out to hug our son.You have taught me that we are not bound together solely by our nationality, language, religion, culture, race, social or economic status, he said. We are bound by our humanity."},
{"title": "How parents tackle bedtime around the world", "cate": "health", "content": "It's a precious moment for families around the world when twilight falls, children yawn and bedtime routines engage.Yet the places where children sleep, the time they lay down at night and even how they prepare for shut-eye vary across cultures. Even differences in children's bedrooms around the world can be striking, as inVenice-basedphotographer James Mollison's photo series , which has been adapted into a book.Though it has been nearly seven years since the series was published, the photographs still spark conversation as they turn a lens to .While photographing the series, I met many families who sleep together in one room or children who sleep in a space of convenience, rather than a place they can in any sense call their room, Mollison said.I came to appreciate just how privileged I was to have had my own bedroom to sleep in and grow, he said. I met children who had literally nothing except for a place to sleep and other children who couldn't move for all their toys.Here is a sampling of what bedtime looks like in households around the world.While researching children's sleep across the globe, clinical psychologist Jodi Mindell was\u00a0surprised\u00a0to discover significant differences in bedtimes for infants and toddlers based on where they lived.She described the differences as unbelievable.When I walked into doing this study, I really thought we would see\u00a010- or 15-minute differences, said Mindell, a professor at Saint Joseph's University in Philadelphia and associate director of the Sleep Center at .It turned out, however, we're seeing these 2\u00bd-hour differences between some countries like Australia and New Zealand\u00a0with\u00a0other countries like Hong Kong and Korea, she said. Bedtimes\u00a0ranged dramatically across cultures.Mindell and her colleagues analyzed how the parents of 29,287 infants and toddlers, up to 3 years old, responded to questionnaires about their children's bedtimes. Those findings were  in 2010.The parents were from China, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Korea, Japan, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States. They completed the questionnaires between May and June 2006, September and December 2007 and April 2008. The researchers found that the latest bedtimes were reported among parents in Hong Kong, who on average reported bedtimes about 10:17 p.m., whereas the earliest bedtimes were reported among parents in New Zealand: around 7:28 p.m., on average.The study was sponsored by pharmaceutical company Johnson & Johnson, and Mindell has served as a consultant for the company.Bedtimes also appear to vary across European countries, said Sara Harkness, a professor and director of the Center for the Study of Culture, Health, and Human Development at the University of Connecticut.She was not involved in the Sleep Medicine study but has conducted research on children's activities and bedtimes.We certainly did find in our research in Spain that early bedtimes were not common for young children. In fact, on one occasion, our Spanish colleague invited us to watch preschool children in a performance at a local festival starting about 11 p.m., Harkness said.The most dramatic contrast we've seen to this pattern is in the Netherlands, where babies and young children are put to bed at around 6:30 or 7 and expected to sleep through the night in their own bed, often in their own room, she said. On the other hand, in small-scale traditional preindustrial societies such as the Kipsigis people of Kenya, where we did research in the 1970s, babies were always in close proximity to caretakers, generally their mother or an older sibling, and they slept anywhere and any time, she said.Around the world, there are not only differences in when babies snooze but in what happens before they slumber.In the United States, it's common for parents to prepare their children for bedtime with a soothing bath followed by a lullaby or, for older kids, a book.Yet around the world, bedtime routines involve a different approach, and in some places, they appear to be less common.One of the biggest similarities is that most families include in their child's bedtime routine, for 0-3, some type of feeding, whether it's breastfeeding or bottle-feeding or snacks, and that's consistent across all countries, but if we take that out, there's big differences in activities like bathing, Mindell said, .In the US, 60% of families have a bath as part of their bedtime routine. It's even higher in the United Kingdom at 81%. But somewhere like India, only 13%. In Indonesia, it's only 6%, she said. They typically bathe in the morning or at another time of the day.There are also regional differences in which bedtime routines include prayers, Mindell added.In the Philippines, 29% of families -- basically one out of three families -- include prayers as part of their bedtime routine, she said. Whereas some place like Australia, only 6% did. In Indonesia, 30% include prayers as part of their bedtime routine.Once the time comes to actually get some shut-eye, parents use different approaches to get their children to sleep.In Korea, Harkness said, parents often sleep with their babies to help them drift into dreamland, but Dutch parents tend to leave their babies alone in their rooms, where the children must learn to put themselves to sleep.The Dutch parents in our studies strongly supported a cultural rule of the ' -- rust, regelmaat, en reinheid, or 'rest, regularity and cleanliness' -- which entailed establishing a firm routine featuring plenty of sleep on a regular schedule from an early age, Harkness said.Similar differences emerge among bed-sharing practices.Co-sleeping is the usual practice in preindustrial societies around the world where there are no special beds for babies to sleep safely by themselves. Co-sleeping on mats on the floor is a cultural norm in Asia, where the family traditionally co-sleeps together in the same room. Mats are brought out at night, then stored during the day so the same room is both a living room and a sleeping room, Harkness said.We found more tolerance for co-sleeping for at least part of the night for babies and young children in European communities we studied, but this may have changed more recently following pediatric advice, she said.In the United States, the  against sharing a bed with your infant and says there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against the use of devices promoted to make bed-sharing 'safe.' The US parents seem to receive more strict guidance, especially from pediatricians, about avoiding co-sleeping, Harkness said. This is part of a larger set of advice about sleeping arrangements, including not using padded 'bumpers' around cribs, having the baby sleep on its back and not using covers such as quilts or blankets for babies -- all for the same purpose of avoiding the danger of suffocation.All in all, bedtime routines can , Mindell said.Bedtime routines are the perfect package for not only sleep, but for promoting positive child development, Mindell said.\u00a0Children who have consistent bedtime routines not only\u00a0sleep\u00a0better, but it also promotes\u00a0things like literacy, attachment, language, bonding and self-care\u00a0-- all the things that we want children to have, whether or not they live in India or whether they live in the United States, she said."},
{"title": "When kids get their first cell phones around the world", "cate": "health", "content": "Sara Zaske's daughter, Sophia, rarely showed much interest in having her own cell phone -- that is, until they moved back to the United States from Germany.About six years ago, when Sophia was just a toddler, Zaske and her husband moved the family from Oregon to Berlin. By the time Sophia was in third grade in Berlin, almost no one in her class owned a cell phone, let alone a smartphone, Zaske said, and Sophia hardly noticed.At that time, she only knew a few kids who had a phone, and most of those phones were flip phones and not connected to the internet, Zaske said. About  ages 6 to 13 report having their own mobile phone, according to a  by the  in Germany.But when Zaske and her family moved to California's San Francisco Bay Area, Sophia entered fourth grade and became the only student in her class without a smartphone, Zaske said, and the girl noticed.So she tells me, 'I think I might need a phone, Mom.' And I say, 'What for? You didn't need it before; why do you need it now?'  said Zaske, author of the upcoming book , to publish in January.We intend to give Sophia a flip phone next year so that she can call us and make plans with friends after school more easily, but we will hold off on the smartphone until high school, she said.As in most developed countries, Zaske said, many German children had access to smartphones or computers in their homes, but owning their own mobile device was not as common as it appears to be among children and teens in the United States.Here is a sampling of at what age children around the world are given their own cell phones.Across Europe, about 46% of children 9 to 16 own a smartphone, according to a study published in the journal  in 2015.The study surveyed about 3,500 children in Belgium, Denmark, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Romania and the United Kingdom between 2013 and 2014.Back in 2014, around 80% of children owned either a mobile phone or a smartphone; 46% owned a smartphone and 33% a mobile phone, said Giovanna Mascheroni, a senior lecturer at the Universit\u00e0 Cattolica of Milan in Italy and lead author of the study.Yet, she added, there were differences across countries in how much children were allowed to use their smartphones in school and other places.Children in Italy and the UK were more likely to be restricted at school. They had no access to Wi-Fi and had to turn off their smartphones, whereas children in Denmark reported using the smartphone for class activities more frequently, Mascheroni said. Children in Portugal were more affected by the economic crisis, so they reported not having an internet plan any longer because it was too expensive, she said. In general, though, children across countries were sensitive to costs. They used Wi-Fi networks when possible and switched 3G or 4G off to save money and power.In the United States, cell phone ownership seems to begin at a younger age. In a , about 45% of US children 10 to 12 had their own smartphone with a service plan, as opposed to just using Wi-Fi.When did kids get a service plan? About 22% did so around age 10, 15% at ages 9 or 11, and 16% around age 8, according to the report.A separate report released last month by the nonprofit organization  found that 42% of US children 8 and younger now have their own tablet devices.Those numbers came as no shock to Douglas Gentile, a psychology professor at Iowa State University who was not involved in the new report but has studied the effects of media use on children.It's not surprising, because it's what we look around ourselves and can see. I can see it at the airport, for example. I can see it at restaurants, and I can even see it in my own home where my younger daughter watches almost no television, but she'll watch lots of TV shows on her phone, Gentile in October.Outside the US and Europe, children tend to own their first mobile phones when they are older. In South Korea, about 72% of children owned a smartphone by ages 11 to 12, and they would spend up to  on them, according to a study published last year in the journal . In comparison, adults reported spending about 3.8 hours on their phones, according to the study.It seems that Korean children start to have their own mobile phone around second to third grade, and by the time they become fourth-graders, most of them have mobile phones, said Yoori Hwang, a researcher at Myongji University in Seoul and lead author of the study.Among Taiwanese children, the numbers of those who used cell phones rose steadily from 45% of 11-year-olds to about 71% of 15-year-olds, according to a study published in the  in 2015.In Turkey, there was no consensus among parents regarding the best time for their kids to have mobile phones, according to a study published last year in the . The study involved 333 participants.We asked the parents the optimal time to buy a mobile phone for their children; approximately 19.5% of the parents responded as 6 to 11 years; 59.8% of the parents responded as 12 to 17 years, said Dr. Meltem Dinleyici, assistant professor in pediatrics at the Eskisehir Osmangazi University Faculty of Medicine and lead author of the study.According to the parent's responses, 3.3% indicated that there was no need for the presence of a mobile phone for children until the age of 18, Dinleyici said.About four out of five, or 81%, of secondary school students in South Africa own or have access to a mobile phone, and about 31% have their own social network page, according to a  in 2013.Among children 9 to 18 in Ghana, 18.8% of boys and 12.9% of girls own a mobile phone, according to a study published in the  in 2015. It also showed that among children in Malawi, 10.4% of boys and 6.2% of girls own a mobile phone.Overall, according to the study, ownership of mobile phones climbed between 2007 and 2014 from about 0.6% to 8.4% in Malawi, 2.4% to 16.2% in Ghana and 21% to 50.8% in South Africa.In a study of fourth-year primary school children in Australia, nearly 31% owned or used a mobile phone at the start of the study. A  year later, 43% did, according to their parents. For the study, published in the journal  in June, data were collected on 412 children from 36 schools in Melbourne and Wollongong between 2010 and 2013.Parents were asked at what age their child first owned or used a mobile phone. The median age was 8 years, said Mary Redmayne, an adjunct research fellow at Monash University in Australia and a co-author of the study.It seems that many parents of primary school children want to be able to contact their child, but we have not researched this, she said. It would be interesting to know other reasons.All in all, the  notes that there is no right age to expose your child to screens or hand them their own cell phone.Last year, however, the  for . For instance, it recommended that children younger than 18 to 24 months avoid using digital media regularly, except when video-chatting.The academy also advised that for children 2 to 5, screen time should be limited to one hour per day. No matter the age, the academy recommended to avoid using media as the only way to calm your child, monitor your child's media content and what apps are used or downloaded, avoid screens one hour before bedtime, and keep meal times screen-free."},
{"title": "How does your child's screen time measure up?  ", "cate": "health", "content": "It's not unusual for children to sulk or throw a tantrum when parents demand they switch off the television or put down the phone, but for parents, what's on that screen -- or how long a child has been staring at it -- is the bigger worry.The  warns that overuse of digital media and screens can put children and teens at risk of obesity, sleep problems, cyberbullying and negative performance at school. There are also safety concerns: The academy encourages parents to talk to their children about online safety and safeguarding privacy, ask them to refrain from risky online behavior like sexting and be wary of online solicitations.Just how much time are children spending buried in screens? by Common Sense Media said children up to age 8 spend an average of 2 hours and 19 minutes every day on screen media. The lion's share of that time is occupied by TV and video viewing alone; it takes up 72% of all screen time.That's an increase from 2011, when the average daily screen media time for the same age group was 1 hour 55 minutes. Time spent on most devices, including TV, computers, video games and DVDs, has dropped since 2011, but time spent on mobile phones has increased significantly. (The recent results were obtained through a survey of 1,454 parents of children age 8 or under conducted in January and February.)For 8- to 12-year-olds, the average time spent using screen media every day was 4 hours and 36 minutes, according to a . Tweens spent an average of 4\u00bd hours per day with screen media and 6 hours with all media, including reading and listening to music.The report said the top activity among tweens was watching TV: Nearly 62% of those surveyed said they watch TV every day. But according to the 2015 report, there are differences in how tweens of different genders use their screen time. Boys spend more time playing console video games, while girls spend more time on music and social media. Mobile devices accounted for 41% of all screen time among tweens. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends limiting screen media use for children younger than 18 months to video chatting. For older children, it advises that parents choose high-quality content and watch it with their children to help them understand what they're seeing. Moreover, the academy says that screen media use should not interfere with children's sleep and exercise routines. The organization urges parents to ensure that their children have media-free times with the family and designate areas of the home as media-free zones. "},
{"title": "How many kids still believe in Santa?", "cate": "health", "content": "Santa Claus is coming to town -- or so about 85% of young American children believe.In interviews, 85% of 4-year-olds said that they believed in Santa, 65% of 6-year-olds said that they believed, and 25% of 8-year-olds said that they believed. Those numbers were published in a small study in the  in 1978.But researchers say those percentages of young children who believe in jolly old Saint Nick seem to have remained steady over the years. Research in the  in 2011 shows that 83% of 5-year-olds think that Santa Claus is real, the study's lead author, Jacqueline Woolley,  last year.We have found in more recent studies that that number of 85% sounds about right, said Thalia Goldstein, assistant professor of applied developmental psychology at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia.Children's belief in Santa starts when they're between 3 and 4 years old. It's very strong when they're between about 4 and 8, she said. Then, at 8 years old is when we start to see the drop-off in belief, when children start to understand the reality of Santa Claus.Nearly three-quarters of Americans say they typically received Christmas Eve visits from Santa as children, and one in five adults says they are the parent or guardian of a child in their home who believes in Santa, according to a  published in 2013.Outside the United States, how many children believe in Papa Noel? The percentage appears to be similar in some European countries.Of 161 parents in the United Kingdom, 92.5% thought Father Christmas was real for their children up to the age of 8, according to a research paper presented at the annual meeting of the  in Finland in 1999.It turns out that the more live Santa Clauses children are exposed to, the more likely they are to believe that he is the real Santa, according to a study published last year in .Goldstein co-authored the small study with Woolley, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin.The study involved 77 children, 2 to 10 years old, who were interviewed after visiting a man dressed up as Santa Claus at a children's science museum in Norwalk, Connecticut. The interviews were conducted over the course of one week, before Christmas.The interviews revealed that 39.2% of the children believed that the man they visited was the same Santa who came down their chimneys. An additional 38.8% didn't believe that he was the same person but thought he also lived at the North Pole and could communicate with the real Santa, Goldstein said.Then, 13.8% said that the man was not Santa but that he shared characteristics with the real Santa, and 1.3% had a somewhat adult belief, Goldstein said, in which they said that the man was not Santa and did not live at the North Pole but could communicate with the real Santa.A limitation of the study was that older children who do not believe in Santa were excluded from the sample of participants since they may have been reluctant to accompany their parents to this event, the researchers wrote.Age didn't predict whether or not they thought that live Santa was the real guy, and then we also found that what the parents were telling the children -- the amount of Santa activities and Santa promotion that the parents were engaging with -- also didn't affect whether or not the children believed that he was the real-life Santa, Goldstein said. The only thing that affected their belief was how many other Santa Clauses they had interacted with that year, she said.On the other hand, age and cognitive development seem to predict when kids start to lose their belief in Santa, said Andrew Shtulman, a cognitive developmental psychologist and associate professor at Occidental College in Los Angeles.It's not a coincidence that children stop believing in Santa during the early elementary school years, because that's a time when they are developing more sophisticated notions of what is possible and what is not, said Shtulman, who has led .In one of our studies, we asked children to brainstorm a list of questions to ask Santa, and we compared the kinds of questions they brainstormed to their ability to distinguish possible events from impossible ones, Shtulman said. We found that the better children did on our test of possibility judgment, the more skepticism they expressed in their questions, he said.For instance, Shtulman said, children would shift from asking factual questions such as how tall is the North Pole? or what are your elves' names? to more probing ones, such as how do you fit inside chimneys? and how do you know whether I've been naughty or nice? As children move from belief in Father Christmas to doubt, most tend to feel proud that they have solved a sort of holiday puzzle, Goldstein said.They now get to be part of this sort of more grown-up group of people that doesn't necessarily believe in Santa Claus, Goldstein said.If a parent finds that their child stops believing in Santa and is really upset about it, there are other options, she said. You can always talk about Santa Claus as being a spirit of giving. Or as a way to help others, or a way to think about people who maybe aren't as fortunate as you are."},
{"title": "Why did you become a parent? The answer could help you be a better one", "cate": "health", "content": "Have you ever asked yourself why you wanted (or want) to have children? Those who wrestled with the decision or struggled to conceive a child have probably thought about it a good deal. And some have always known the answer, maybe since they were kids themselves.But for many parents and would-be parents, the question may seem odd or elementary -- which makes it a great question to tackle.One answer is that we, as a species, harbor an evolutionary drive to propagate. Our small part -- at its most basic, perhaps unconscious and even (by design) pleasurable level -- is to carry on our DNA to the next generation. If enough of us do that (and we avoid destroying the planet), human beings will thrive.Another answer is simply social and cultural norms. The majority of the people you know, and most of those you don't, are doing it. This is why people who don't have kids often have an answer to Why? at the ready: because everyone asks them. Rarely, though, are parents asked what motivated them to have kids. There's little need to explain behavior that is typical and expected.But even with evolutionary hardwiring and societal peer pressure as part of the equation, that usually doesn't fully explain the unique, individual drives that lead people to want to make other people. Whatever your reason, it says something important about you and about the kind of parent you are or hope to be. I think it's worth exploring.Why did you decide to have children? Why do you want one, or a second or third? What is it about your personal desires, history, influences and beliefs that led to such a major life decision? Why spend so much time and money, and take on all that additional stress, anxiety and responsibility?Knowing why you got into this game can give you the insight needed to play it to the best of your ability. You are your own best guide to navigating the million and one parenting questions, conundrums and choices you will face from here on out.Historically, people have had children out of economic necessity, to work the farm, for example. Conversely, children can be symbols of prosperity. They can be a reflection of yourself or a vessel for your own wishes and goals. Or parenting can be a noble act of sacrifice for the greater good.Pete Seeger is credited with this sweet answer: We do it for the high wages ... kisses.When I asked friends and family this question, it was interesting to see how some knew their answers right away while others stared off in the distance with a puzzled look on their faces, as if they'd never pondered it before.Here's a taste:My wife had her answer at the ready: I wanted to feel the intense love a parent has for a child. It's a desire she's had since she was a young girl.As I began to tell her my reason, I saw a nervous look on her face. I feel like we should have had this conversation before we had kids, she said, cutting me off. What if I don't think your answer is a good one?Too late, I said. My reasoning lies in the high premium I put on experience: travel. Film. Reading. Writing. Storytelling. Humor. Food and drink (more drink than food). Spirituality. Nature. Being a parent is a unique experience. I am aware of the missed adventures and career options I might have pursued were it not for my two daughters. But still, being their father comes out far ahead.I also hubristically thought I'd be very good at parenting. There's a part of me that wanted to improve upon my own upbringing. Since I was a kid, I'd been convinced I would be an amazing father.That was, of course, before I became one. Parenting, it turns out, is humbling in the way it exposes your insecurities and personality flaws. I'm getting better, and I try to live up to that potential, but I routinely fall short -- which every parent can relate to.Mindful parenting is one of the most enlightened trends in the history of parenting techniques. It's about being present with your children but also better understanding your motivations and feelings while parenting. Getting in touch with your motivation for becoming a parent gives you a perspective too often lacking at difficult parenting moments.My answer, about wanting these unique and varied parenting experiences, has helped me embrace a wider spectrum of them. It's easy to revel in a bear hug or a shared laugh, but I'm extending that love of experience for more challenging moments, such getting screamed at in the middle of a bath time.Staying present and connected to whatever is going on when I'm with my daughters gives them more of the attention they need from me and makes meaningful moments more frequent and poignant.Your own answer to the question is something of a parental compass needle too, pointing the way when you are unsure how to parent in a given situation.Get back to the roots of your parenting motivation. It could impact how you respond to frustrating moments, how you spend your weekends, what behavior you model and how you talk to your children about life.This column, , is getting a spinoff series called Go Ask Your Dad, about parenting wisdom. There is no shortage of parenting advice out there -- professional, familial, terrible -- but there is not enough that looks beyond the new trend or list of tips to get at what we want out of life for ourselves and our children.Go Ask Your Dad will explore useful paradigms and best parenting practices that will help you think of old problems in new ways or new problems previous generations didn't face. And for free, I'll throw in social science research, personal anecdotes and too many metaphors. We all need guideposts through this (at times, uncharted) desert, so that we know we're on the right path. Start with the question of why you headed out on the path in the first place. The answer to why you became a parent will help you more clearly draw your map."},
{"title": "Would you let your child play football?", "cate": "health", "content": "As safety concerns such as ,  and  have emerged around college football and the NFL in recent years, some parents have questioned whether to start their kids in the beloved pastime. But is that really keeping them away? In 2016, an estimated 982,000 US children ages 6 to 12 were core participants in tackle football, according to a Sports and Fitness Industry Association survey conducted on more than 24,000 individuals and households. The number includes any child, boy or girl, who has participated in tackle football 26 or more times a year, whether it is through football organizations, school or even pickup games, the association said. That's a 1.8% dip in participation since 2011 -- between 2012 and 2014, youth participation was shrinking by the tens of thousands each year -- but numbers have started to grow, including a 1.7% increase from 2015 to 2016. Millions more kids ages 6 to 12 play basketball, baseball and outdoor soccer, according to the association. But some sports have seen larger drops in participation, it said, including track and field, which decreased by 24.7% since 2011, outdoor soccer by 19%, baseball by 8.9% and basketball by 4%.The decrease in football participation may have been due to concerns of player concussions, noted Jon Butler, executive director of Pop Warner Football, a youth football and cheerleading organization. Other factors might include children specializing in individual sports or fewer children playing organized youth sports overall, he said. Pop Warner currently has 88,850 kids ages 6 to 12 enrolled in football and has maintained a total football enrollment of more than 225,000 participants in the past five years, according to the organization. The stability of football participation rates over recent years shows that there is a strong foundation of kids who love to play football with their parents' support, said Steve Alic, a spokesman for USA Football.In , the American Academy of Pediatrics' Council on Sports Medicine and Fitness noted that most youth football injuries are minor, but incidences of severe injuries, catastrophic injuries, and concussion, however, are higher in football than most other team sports and appear to increase with age.In its recommendations, the pediatricians' organization said that officials and coaches must enforce rules of the game to ensure safety and that a culture of tolerance for head first, illegal hits ... has to change. It suggests that participants weigh potential health risks against the recreation benefits of proper tackling. Delaying the introduction of tackling would probably decrease risk or injury, the statement said, and teams should try to have athletic trainers on the sidelines during games and practices. "},
{"title": "Time is up for timeouts", "cate": "health", "content": "Without meaning to, my wife and I conducted an A-B experiment while disciplining our two children. They are 4\u00bd years apart, and somewhere in that gap -- thanks to the suggestions of the progressive, mindful parenting books we regularly consume -- we did away with the popular refuge of nearly all parents (probably since the dawn of time): the timeout. As some Neanderthal dad probably yelled, Go to your part of the cave until you've calmed down!The arguments for the timeout boil down to: 1. It's better than spanking. (True.) 2. Parents want a little time away from a child's aggravating behavior. (No doubt.) Timeouts have been popular for decades and are still recommended by some parenting experts. But it's time to add the timeout to the parental dust bin of history, along with yelling, hitting and missing school in order to help run the farm.Here is the fundamental failure of the timeout: It's tantamount to abandoning your kid when they need you most. If they're acting up, it may be to get your attention. If they are upset or angry, they want you to connect with them (even if they push you away). Your calm, listening presence or a long hug -- not isolation -- is what they need to reconnect to their rational brain.These moments just after upsetting behavior and anger -- yours and theirs -- can move a parent-child relationship closer or farther apart.Need some solid social science to convince you? The National Institute of Mental Health conducted a study in 1982 (the timeout method hasn't changed since then) that found kids who had timeouts -- or love withdrawal, as the study's authors also called the method -- were , even when moms in the study talked to their kids after their timeout reflection.Premier parenting academic Alfie Kohn has written extensively about the negative effects on a child's moral and psychological development due to timeouts and other love-withdrawal techniques. He cites child psychologist Bruno Bettelheim, who concluded that timeouts can cause deep feelings of anxiety. And if you're telling yourself a timeout is not a punishment but rather a much-needed break for reflection and self-calming, let me ask you: Does your child think it's a punishment? If so, then it is.Describing timeouts in their book How to Talk so Kids Can Learn, Adele Faber and Elaine Mazlish write, As an adult you can imagine how resentful and humiliated you would feel if someone forced you into isolation for something you said or did.I bet most parents who use the timeout -- which seems to work in the short run (perhaps because it triggers a child's , according to developmental psychologist Aletha Solter) -- do so because it's expedient. If we had an alternative that worked more effectively and just as swiftly, we'd gladly use it.The answer is time-ins. That sounds too cute to be real advice, but maybe it's just catchy enough that you will remember it when you're driven to the point of anger and not thinking straight yourself. Fight the urge to push your troubled kid away and work to embrace them instead.When you remove the option of distance and solitude, you have no choice but to engage. That step, by the way, is often all it takes to stop the behavior. But you can also help them calm themselves; a few deep breaths is remarkably effective.And then you both can find a solution together as a team instead of in opposition. Listen fully and patiently to their version of the story. And talk about mitigating factors. Are they hungry, angry, lonely, tired, stressed or sick (a list that forms the handy acronym HALTSS)? Sometimes there are no solutions. We all just need to be heard sometimes. After you understand where they're coming from, try reflecting their feelings back to them. You feel sad that the playdate has to end. That's so frustrating when a plan doesn't work out like we hoped.Time-ins demonstrate to them you care, even when times get tough. It conveys the message that their bad emotions (which are really just difficult, yet perfectly natural, ones) are as acceptable as their pleasant, happy emotions. Time-ins also teach kids to pay closer attention to their feelings and needs, and get better at finding solutions to their problems. These moments -- when, reflexively, a timeout seems the easiest route -- are great parenting opportunities to connect (aka love) and teach life skills. Sometimes, especially with older kids, they may genuinely want you to go away. But stay close. Maybe refrain from talking. If you leave the room, check in after a bit.My wife and I give ourselves timeouts on occasion when we need a break. But sending yourself away is not the same as abandoning them, especially if you explain your emotional state before you excuse yourself. You are modeling the fact that everyone needs to give themselves recovery breaks (whether it's 30 seconds or 30 minutes). Your kids may use it as a model for themselves.I'm guessing you won't be convinced that time-ins are more effective than timeouts unless you give it a try. See what happens when you issue no timeouts for a month. It may be a mess at first, but I'm convinced you'll see some significant results within a month.Our home experiment had similar results as the National Institute of Mental Health study. If timeouts were effective, our younger child (who never got one) would be a terror. And our older one would have acted out more when we ceased to deploy them. But neither happened. In fact, we doubled down and largely did away with punishments altogether. The net result has been less confrontation, more cohesion, more solutions.Our first daughter is 10 years old and has recently started the tween-age rite of passage of occasionally storming off to her room. Sometimes, she adds the slammed door as a kinetic exclamation mark. It's a timeout of a different of color -- one she imposes on herself. But my wife or I will check in after a few minutes and see whether she wants to talk. Sometimes, I need to apologize if I'm the one who her upset her. But if she still wants to be by herself, we respect that. She knows we're nearby, always ready for when she needs a time-in. David G.

{"title": "Start a new (good) habit, kill an old (bad) one", "cate": "health", "content": "Odds are, you are trying to break a bad habit or institute a good one right now. As a species, we are impressively committed to self-improvement, and most of us believe that habits are an effective means to that end.Habits -- actions performed with little conscious thought and often unwittingly triggered by external cues -- are powerful influences on behavior and can be our greatest allies for positive change. But because they are so difficult to break, habits are also frequent saboteurs of personal progress. Habit is a good servant but a bad master is how author Gretchen Rubin summed it up in her book Better Than Before: Mastering the Habit of Our Everyday Lives. Hers was one of three recent books I read back-to-back on the subject of habit formation; the others were Charles Duhigg's The Power of Habit and Jeremy Dean's Making Habits, Breaking Habits. Together, they helped me understand more deeply the importance of habit control, how to choose a habit to begin or end, and the mechanics of sticking with it. The first thing to know, each book explained, is that a lot of our daily actions are so rote, they are automatic. All our life ... is but a mass of habits, philosopher and psychologist William James wrote, though a 2006 study put the amount of. Still, that's a lot of mindless behavior.It's helpful that we don't need to think about how or when to drink coffee, brush our teeth or drive to work. If we did, we'd waste so much time rethinking or learning those tasks, we'd get little else done. The whole trick is to get habits to work for you, not against you. Self-control is a limited resource, Dean explains, so a good habit means not having to exert effort every time you need to do the right thing. The first thing to identify for yourself is the habit you want to work on, whether it's starting a new (good) one or ending an old (bad) one. That's a minor distinction, by the way. Eating healthier is eating less junk. Exercising more is being less sedentary. One is often the inverse of another.This step requires some honest self-evaluation. What is not working in your life? What personality flaws are holding you back? Where is there room to do better?We know what many of the most common areas of improvement are, at least when it comes to making resolutions. People want to lose weight, eat better, be more mindful, spend money more wisely, sleep better and improve relationships. By eliminating bad habits and starting new ones, you can succeed in most of these areas.One helpful checklist frequently used for goal-setting is the acronym SMART, created by economic theorist Peter Drucker. Effective resolutions, research has shown, are Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant and Time-bound. Before finishing the first book (Dean's, which is the most prescriptive and research- and science-based), I decided on two habits to work on myself. The first was to be more present and mindful with my kids. The second was to stop seeking out and consuming free, non-nutritious food at work. One was a good habit to start, the other a bad habit to quit.Rubin, who approaches the topic personally and looks for specific techniques that work for her, recommends starting a habit at the same time as a big turning point such as pregnancy, marriage, a medical diagnosis, a family death, an anniversary, a long trip or a new year.The consensus among these books is that the most effective way to adopt a habit is to replace a bad one with a better one. Dean's metaphor is to think of habits as well-worn rivers of action that flow out of the predictable path of your routine. Often, the most effective way to stop it flowing in harmful directions is not by damming it but by diverting it. For example, many people stop smoking by chewing gum. The point is that bad habits die hard, and as with riding a bike, your brain never stops learning how to do them.So it's easier to think about any habit formation, even new good ones, in terms of replacing unwanted behavior. That made sense for my snacking at work. I started buying healthy yet still delicious snacks to keep there: yogurt instead of morning doughnuts, dried papaya instead of chocolate, sweetened rice cakes instead of stale leftover doughnuts. A supply of healthy snack options kept me on a new course of action that largely followed the old eating habit pattern. To be more mindful with my kids, I needed to avoid the opposite behaviors, such as checking my work phone or planning activities while with them so I could focus on their needs and thoughts.Duhigg explains that habit reversal therapy is a legitimate technique used for things like tics and obsessive-compulsive disorder, as well as predilections such as gambling, smoking and bed-wetting.It's important to make a distinction between a bad habit and addiction, however, even if the behaviors seem to overlap. Addiction requires greater intervention than habit hacking. Dean describes the hallmarks of addiction as not being in control and not being aware of time/energy spent on the behavior. People with addictions are preoccupied with soothing a craving and needing more and more to get the same effect, as well as suffering withdrawal without it. Unlike bad habits, addictions eat away at important activities such as relationships and work. They tend to be an escape from normal life and are often hidden from others.We like to think we have free will in every situation, but many of our actions are predictably triggered by external situations. And if those events are part of your daily or weekly routine, our Pavlovian tendencies become ingrained. Pajamas are on: Time to floss and brush. Cup of coffee in hand: Time to dunk a doughnut. Beer finished: Let's have a cigarette. But triggers can also be feelings, such as stress or boredom. Being aware of your triggers is the first step in learning how to keep them from sabotaging you and make them work for you instead. Is there a certain time of day or task when you crave a treat? What do you always do when you feel stress (go for a run or go for a drink)? What is your bedtime ritual to let your brain know it's time to sleep?You can help create conditions to avoid triggers, but not fully. If the trigger is deeply ingrained, maybe going back years, it will sabotage you when your guard is down. For these situations, you need contingencies. Dean calls them  If ... then ... plans. When trigger X happens, I won't do bad habit Y, as I usually do, but I will replace it with much healthier Z action. My favorite example of effective trigger planning is Starbucks, a company that puts a higher premium on customer service than on the (habit-fueled) products it sells. Duhigg, who prefers Malcom Gladwell-esque case studies for his book, explains that the chain's baristas are well trained on what to do when something goes wrong, such as a messed-up order that angers a customer. Rather than improvise or consider options in those moments, they practice rapid responses -- such as apologizing and offering a replacement drink for free -- until it's second nature.You likewise need to have a plan for when a strong, perhaps rare, trigger threatens your winning habit streak. Ordinarily, I can avoid eating cupcakes at work, but what's my plan when I've skipped lunch, it's late afternoon, I have some onerous task that would be made more enjoyable with a treat, and the cupcake is filled with peanut butter? According to one study cited by Dean and Rubin, it takes  to convert it to a habit. However, that number varies depending on the person and activity. For example, it took those participating in the study less than 20 days to habitualize drinking a glass of water every day, 60 days for eating fruit with lunch and more then 84 days to make 50 sit-ups a daily habit. Some habits could take a year to form. But 66 days is a good target.I avoided work snacking and improved my capacity for parental mindfulness for 66 days straight. Or rather, I diligently monitored these habits over 66 days, because another pillar of successful habit formation is tracking. Even something as subjective as be more present with my kids can be numerically self-scored every evening. And another pro tip of habit-making (or replacing) is accountability. Tell other people. Share on social media (unless social media is the habit you're changing). Ask your friends and family to support the effort. Getting others involved, or even just aware, makes it harder for you to give it up. And others' support can be inspiring and helpful.Unlike tracking and accountability, incentives are a debatable strategy. Duhigg believes that they are central to the exercise, because habits are reward-based. Rubin concludes that external rewards take you away from internalizing the right motivation behind your new habit. For me, rewards have been pivotal. Five years ago, I took off 25 pounds and have kept it off by establishing an .If you do treat yourself for keeping a habit, make sure it's not self-defeating. You may not want to reward, say, avoiding doughnuts by indulging in a half-gallon of ice cream. At the end of 66 days, I stopped tracking my new habits and found that they had largely stuck. When I came home from work, seeing the faces of my daughters was the trigger to remind me to give them my undivided focus. I rarely (instead of automatically) checked my phone for work updates, and I put off my personal agenda items until after bedtime. And I replaced workplace snacking with my private stash of more nutritious snacks: same trigger, but alternate behavior at much fewer calories.The real test though, is time. More than six months have passed since my 66 days of daily tracking, and I'm still doing a solid job on mindful parenting. I have occasionally slipped on the work snacking, though. I wouldn't say I've failed at it, because I'm building up a new long-term habit muscle for healthy snacking, and I ate a lot less junk food than I would have without trying. Rubin would call it stumbling, and we should accept that it happens in the habit game. Stumbling is not a reason to quit trying.You may want to read one of the habit books, too. The three overlap and support each other, but my personal preference was for Rubin's, largely because I feel a kinship with her love of life-hacking, introspection and applied psychology. She's the author of the bestselling The Happiness Project and wrote this new book, she explained, after concluding that habits were the best means to actually achieve happiness.But I'll give the last word to the wise Ben Franklin, whose advice would make all these books unnecessary.  'Tis easier to prevent bad habits than to break them, he wrote."},
{"title": "The meaning(s) of (your) life", "cate": "health", "content": "Every January for the past 20 years, I have taken a few moments to ponder the answer to the question what is the meaning of life?It's one of those enormous questions that's so important -- philosophically and practically in terms of how we live our lives -- and yet we never stop to really think about the answer. Given that you might be able to formulate your response in less than a minute, the wisdom-to-effort ratio for this philosophical exercise could not be more advantageous. This simple exercise might even help you live longer. According to two separate studies published in 2014 -- one among  and another among  -- those who could articulate the meaning and purpose of their lives died later than those who saw their lives as aimless. It didn't seem to matter what meaning participants ascribed to their life, whether it was personal (like happiness), creative (like making art) or altruistic (like making the world a better place). It was having an answer to the question that mattered.The connection to longevity could be causal (having purpose may , as other research has shown), but it could also be that those who think about life's meaning are more likely to do other activities that promote good health.The reason I ask this question year after year is because my answer changes over time, which I find interesting and insightful. There is no objectively correct answer, I believe, only answers that are right for you at any given time. Great thinkers (and celebrities) have given the question thought, so you can look to the words attributed to them for inspiration. Aristotle, the Greek philosopher who lived 2,500 years ago, is believed to have written that the essence of life is to serve others and to do good, and the Roman philosopher Cicero, born 280 years later, came to the same conclusion. As did Russian author Leo Tolstoy, who wrote, The sole meaning of life is to serve humanity. And His Holiness the Dalai Lama added, if you can't help them, at least don't hurt them.Scottish rugby legend Nelson Henderson put the same notion poetically when he said, The true meaning of life is to plant trees, under whose shade you do not expect to sit. And actress Whoopi Goldberg's meaning-of-life metaphor was to throw little torches out to lead people through the dark.Love was the conclusion of Trappist monk and writer Thomas Merton, and Buffy the Vampire Slayer actress Julie Benz. Alternatively, actor Arnold Schwarzenegger concluded, The meaning of life is not simply to exist, to survive but to move ahead, to go up, to achieve, to conquer.My favorite answer, though, is the Zen-like circular reasoning attributed to writer Robert Byrne, who put it, The purpose of life is a life of purpose.Some have concluded that life's meaning is subjective. There is not one big cosmic meaning for all, Ana\u00efs Nin wrote in her diary. There is only the meaning we each give to our life, an individual meaning, an individual plot, like an individual novel, a book for each person. I agree, which is why I recommend formulating your own answer. Each man must look to himself to teach him the meaning of life. It is not something discovered: It is something molded, wrote Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry, well-known for his book The Little Prince.Taking a few moments to record your answer to the question what is the meaning of life? is the kind of simple exercise that effectively adds meaning to your life. And then I suggest answering it every year. Looking back at how your thinking has evolved and been influenced by experience tells you something more about yourself. Cumulatively, it gets you closer to a deeper self-understanding. In 1997, my answer was the discovery, pursuit and attainment of one's bliss, inspired by myth expert Joseph Campbell. A year later, is was to make the world a better place. In 2002, the year I got engaged, it was simply Love. And the year we conceived our oldest daughter, it was the less-romantic continuation of one's DNA to the next generation. But most years, my answer is some combination of love, legacy, happiness, experience and helping others. As a practical matter, if you want to do the annual Meaning exercise, I suggest not looking at past answers before answering anew, to avoid biasing your answer. I write them down on the same now-yellowing piece of loose-leaf paper, and keep it someplace safe.The last use of this experiment is to try to turn your answer into action. If you conclude, as Tolstoy and Aristotle did, that the meaning of life to help others, that should help motivate you to do more of it. If love, is the answer, then love more. If it's find your bliss, then get searching for it.This is not a theoretical exercise. Whatever small step you make toward finding the meaning of life is a step toward a more meaningful, and longer, life."},
{"title": "A 'confidence code' for girls: 5 ways to build up our daughters", "cate": "health", "content": "If there's one quality I want my girls to have more than any other, it is confidence.I've seen how important it is in the workplace and in life: Confident people get what they want. They take risks. They are not afraid of failure. Growing up as a perfectionist, somewhat fearful of both failure and success, I wish I had the confidence in my teens and early 20s that I have now.For all these reasons, I was thrilled when one of my daughters, during the first grade, had to name five words to describe herself. Confident was on her list. I thought then and still think now, What can I do to make sure she feels that way when she is a teenager?Journalist, author and speaker  has some answers. In 2014, she and her co-author, Katty Kay, anchor of BBC World News America, published  The book resonated deeply with women and quickly became a bestseller.As Shipman and Kay traveled the country to speak about the book, one of the most common questions they would get was from parents, women and men, who were concerned about their daughters. 'What about my daughter? I see this in my daughter,'  Shipman said they would say. It was just this huge focus on young women and girls. 'What can I be doing with my girls, because I already see she's not this. She's experiencing that.'   Shipman, who spent a decade at CNN as a White House and international correspondent in the 1990s, said she and Kay did some research and found that there were plenty of books on the topic for parents but not as many specifically written for girls. So they decided to write one for girls in middle school, although it is applicable for girls up through high school, Shipman says.In Shipman and Kay use graphic novel illustrations, quizzes, checklists and real stories from girls to try to make the topic accessible and relatable.They also commissioned an online poll, which backs up what other research has shown.Between the ages of 8 and 14, girls' confidence drops by 30%, . The survey also found that three out of four teen girls worry about failing,We were surprised at how quickly, how deep that drop is, Shipman said. And especially because right until age 8, there's really no difference in confidence levels.So how do we stop this troubling trend? I asked Shipman, a mom of two,  for some advice -- advice she said she's using with her 13-year-old daughter, with good results.One of the most important things we can do as parents of daughters, Shipman said, is to help them get comfortable being uncomfortable. Shipman said she and Kay feel that if they do nothing else in this book but get girls to walk away and understand that it's cool to take risks, they will have succeeded.As for how to do that, a parent can talk to their daughter about how they approach a risk and some of the ways they can support themselves. It's kind of counterintuitive, but just telling yourself 'Oh, you shouldn't be afraid of this' or 'there's nothing scary about it' or 'fake it until you make it,' that doesn't actually help. Risks can be scary, Shipman said.So encourage your daughter and tell her, Yes, it's normal to feel afraid. This is a little frightening, but tell yourself 'I'm just going to do it afraid. I'm just going to do it anyway,'  Shipman said.Having your daughter keep a list of the risks she has taken and how she worked through them can be a reminder of what she is capable of, Shipman said. The same holds true for failures: Listing their failures and how they tackled them can be incredibly empowering.Also, have them keep a list of some stock phrases that they can tell themselves when they are in a bit of a frightening situation, such as I've done something like this before. I can do it. I've got it.Our girls need to know that failure will undoubtedly happen and that it's not something they can avoid. But knowing how to deal with it can help. We all need a cheat sheet to failure, Shipman and Kay write.They offer a list of 10 failure fixes such as change the channel. Encourage your daughter to do anything that helps her get in a better place, whether that is reading a book, watching TV, listening to music or cuddling with a family pet. This will help distract her from what's happened and help her stop thinking about it over and over again.Another fix is putting it in perspective. Shipman talks about an idea she and Kay heard from a middle school counselor, which she called a virtual hot air balloon ride. Help your daughter envision herself up in the sky with the clouds and looking down at the situation that happened. First, that lets her kind of literally put it in perspective, like, 'Wow, look, other things are going on,' and then see it from a different angle and talk about it that way.Trying to keep a sense of humor is also key. Of course, this is not easy when your daughter is melting down after what she considers the biggest failure of her life. But try to help her see that it could be much worse. Thoughts like 'at least I didn't forget to put on pants and go to school naked after our roof caved in' ... can remind you that it really could be worse! they write.One of the more surprising results (at least to me) from the poll Shipman and Kay commissioned is that fathers seem to be better at recognizing a lack of confidence in their daughters than mothers: They were found to be 26% more likely to accurately estimate their child's confidence than moms were.How could that be? Aren't mothers supposed to be the more intuitive parents? But as Shipman did her research, she found that mothers perhaps don't see their daughters' behavior as unusual.Perfectionism or worry about this or that, or sort of reticence to raise your hand, that's recognizable to us, Shipman said. Even if instinctively we know it's wrong, it doesn't seem odd, because we've probably experienced it. We may still do it, whereas I think fathers, who do have incredibly high expectations for their daughters, would be (saying) 'What is going on with my 9-year-old? Why was she this way a year ago, and now she's thinking she can't do anything?' They find it genuinely strange.The takeaway is how influential role modeling can be for our kids. Let them see us, especially mothers, dealing with failure and struggle and taking risks.If we're going on, 'I'm so worried about this. I have to get it right,' it doesn't help them, Shipman said. She's tried to take this advice even more with her teenage daughter and lift the veil a little bit.When she's upset about something, for instance, such as having to rewrite a few chapters for a book, she lets her daughter see how she's feeling and then raises the question whether she's overreacting and figures out how she's going to deal with it -- all in front of her daughter.With all the talk about girls and confidence, it's important to make it clear to our girls that it's not like they have a problem that needs to be fixed, Shipman said. Girls are the way they are for a host of reasons, including nature (brain biology) and nurture (society's different expectations for girls and boys.) They also often have a higher level of emotional intelligence.It's not like we want to churn out a bunch of girls who operate like boys, Shipman said. I think it would be wonderful for young women to understand much earlier on, essentially, the world doesn't operate like school.Helping girls understand at young ages what skills will be important later in life is key, including the ability to advocate for themselves and not worry about being people pleasers, Shipman said.Girls, even when they speak up in class or whatever it is, they want to please people, so I feel like the next hurdle is for girls to understand that they will not always please people. People won't always like them, Shipman said. And when they speak up, some people will like what they say, and others won't, and how do they develop that armor so that they say 'but that's OK, because I'm me.'  "},
{"title": "Move over, 'sit still'! Why kids need to move in school ", "cate": "health", "content": "A few years ago, when my girls were in the second and third grades, they raved about the dance breaks they would occasionally have during the school day.Their teachers would put on a video, which encouraged the kids to get up and dance, and then they'd get back to work. What a brilliant idea, I remember thinking at the time.My kids' teachers were certainly not alone. More teachers are incorporating some form of movement into the school day, especially as the research is pretty clear: Physical activity in school leads to better cognitive performance and fewer behavioral issues, not to mention cutting down on stress and anxiety.Groups such as the  tout the importance of teaching kids to move while they're young so that they will make movement part of their lives when they grow up.It all seems like a no-brainer, especially as. As former first lady Michelle Obama advocated, let's get our kids to move.The challenge, though, is persuading school administrations to consistently make time for physical activity when they are pressed to meet stringent academic requirements and find the money to pay for some of the training. Just as our schools teach math literacy and reading literacy, they can teach physical literacy, teaching children the basics of movement so that they can stay active for life, said Susan Kamin, chief wellness officer for the National Association of Physical Literacy.The for-profit association provides in-person and online training to teachers and communities and provides BrainErgizer videos, five-minute movement videos developed in conjunction with the University of Connecticut based on research on what stimulates the brain. , an associate clinical professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, says activity breaks during the school day create better learners because of the impact of movement on the brain.When you move, you stimulate all the nerve cells that we use to think with, and when you stimulate those nerve cells, it gets them ready to do stuff, said Ratey, an expert in neuropsychiatry and author of  who has spent the past 30 years focusing on the attention systems of the brain.When you exercise, you turn on the attention systems, so that means you're (paying) better attention, you're able to deal with more frustration, you're able to stay with it longer, he said. You're able to manipulate information by turning ... on the front part of our brain to make it work better, and that's really key and important in terms of taking in information as well as performing with it.A recent study, a review of 26 previous studies looking at the impact of physical activity on academic performance, found that kids who get extra physical activity in school do better in reading and math. The study, , involved more than 10,000 children between the ages of 4 and 13. It found that physical activity, especially physical education, improves behavior in classrooms and is a boost to academic achievement, especially math-related skills and reading.The research shows that it leads to better cognitive function for kids so they're going to have better results, academically, Kamin said. It's also going to help with behavioral issues in the classroom, because if kids are able to move, they're not going to have so much excess energy. They're going to be able to focus, and it's going to solve a lot of the sort of interpersonal issues that come up with kids as well, because they're going to have an opportunity to get that energy out.Breakthrough Magnet School, South, a pre-K through eighth-grade school in Hartford, Connecticut, is in its third year working with the National Association of Physical Literacy. The school had valued movement and mindfulness before, but since the partnership, the school has received additional training and is making physical literacy a key part of the classroom experience, Principal Julie Goldstein said.I think it really validates a lot of what teachers know: that students need movement, they need planned opportunities for movement and that it can be done in a pretty short, simple way throughout the day and that the benefits of it outweigh the little bit of planning that is necessary in the beginning to kind of get that structured, Goldstein said.Her third- and fourth-graders who are actively engaged in physical literacy are the highest-scoring students in math and literacy within the district, she said. Beyond the benefits academically, there are benefits outside the classroom. For this school year, not one student from this group has been referred to her office for a conversation with the principal. Before they started doing physical literacy, she might have had one or two office referrals every month, she said.This particular grade level is at the highest risk for misunderstandings, disagreements and even injuries at recess time, and we've had none, so the impact that it is has goes far beyond just the academic and the behaviors in the classroom, she said. Even during the unstructured times, they're better able to manage themselves, to play independently and to do that in a way so that the recess time actually serves them the way it's intended to, which is to give them time to play and have fun.Four out of five elementary schools in the United States are using videos from the education company  to promote physical activity in the classroom, the company says.The concept is simple: Today's kids have grown up with screens, so GoNoodle tries to use entertaining videos, often about two minutes in length, that will get kids to move around and then either get back to their schoolwork or go off and play with friends.KC Estenson is the chief executive officer of GoNoodle, a for-profit company that makes money through relationships with partners who believe in the company's mission. (The videos are free for schools and parents, although teachers can pay for GoNoodle+, which for $10 a month gives them access to additional videos, games and classroom resources.)Estenson -- who is the former head of CNN Digital -- is a father of three who, like most parents, has struggled with how much time his kids, ages 8, 12 and 14, spend on screens during the day.GoNoodle gets kids to move. It gets them to be active, Estenson said. The entire purpose of this is a whole new interaction form with the screen, which is active engagement versus passive engagement, and most television and most of what's happening with the technology now of all ages is passive, binge viewing, hours spent just watching the screen and doing nothing else.The key, he said, is making entertaining content that children (the target group is ages 5 to 12, grades K-6) will enjoy so much that they'll want to get up and dance or do yoga or even some form of meditation and mindfulness.And so starting from the earliest age ... we're putting positive associations between the right things that are available to them on these screens and hopefully giving them an awesome alternative to the junk food that's out there, said Estenson.which was founded as part of Obama's Let's Move initiative, is a national movement, partnering with nonprofits and for profits to try to make physical education and physical activity a bigger part of the school day.The goal is at least 60 minutes of activity per day, which is crucial especially since many kids don't get the play time children used to get outside of school decades ago. There are a variety of reasons why, including the widespread use of digital devices and a lack of access to and time for free play.One of the biggest pieces of feedback we get from schools in the field is, 'we are very busy places. We appreciate what everyone offers, but it's overwhelming. Can you make it easier for us to know what's available?'  said Charlene Burgeson, executive director of Active Schools.Streamlining to make it less cumbersome for schools to learn what resources are available and what programs they can bring to their school is one challenge. The others are money, time and philosophy.Schools can't always find the funding to pay for formal training, videos and other programs that get kids moving. There is also the pressure of the clock and having enough time to work physical activity in when trying to meet the required academic standards and complete the curriculum.I know lots of teachers who say, 'Yeah, I wish I had more time to do this,'  the National Association of Physical Literacy's Kamin said. Even in schools that can find the time, there is still some opposition because it's a departure from the way things used to be, she said.It's a big change for some of the teachers. They're not sure that they want to make that leap. It's sort of 'if it's not broke, why fix it?'  Yet the schools that have made the leap see tremendous results. So how do you move the needle?"},
{"title": "Signs of ADHD can be different in girls", "cate": "health", "content": "When asked to describe a typical child with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), most people would describe a young boy who climbs on things, is impatient and does not do what he is told. Few people would describe a bubbly young girl with lots of friends, who works hard to get good grades.It may be, however, that the girl does experience ADHD symptoms that interfere with her daily life -- and that these symptoms are overlooked by the adults around her.Undiagnosed ADHD has long-term consequences including an  -- such as unprotected sex and substance use -- as well as . Perhaps most alarmingly, girls who struggle with ADHD for a long period of time can .As a psychologist in clinical practice, I used to see many older girls and adult women with ADHD who had already been prescribed medication to treat anxiety and depression. Early diagnosis then is vital.Individuals with ADHD exhibit three main clusters of symptoms: hyperactivity, impulsivity and inattention. Although three times as many boys are diagnosed with ADHD in childhood than girls, the  are more equally divided between males and females. This suggests girls go unnoticed when they are younger.As a disorder traditionally seen as affecting males, and with males referred more often for a diagnosis, research to assess ADHD has been based on samples largely consisting of boys. It has been argued that the rating scales developed to assess ADHD have been  in the mainly male research samples.ADHD can look different in girls than boys. A boy who is hyperactive might have trouble sitting in his seat in the classroom -- so he sits with one knee on the seat and one foot on the floor. It is likely, given his constant shifting and unequal balance on the seat, that the back legs of the chair will eventually lift up and the chair pitch forward causing the boy to fall to the floor.In contrast, a hyperactive girl may be out of her seat but have taken on the role of classroom helper, wandering around to different desks. A teacher completing a rating scale might rate the boy higher on hyperactive questions than the girl because the second example is not seen as disruptive. Thus, girls do not score as high as boys on these scales and are underrepresented because they do not meet criteria for a diagnosis.Not only do symptoms of ADHD look different in boys but boys also have a tendency to be more hyperactive and impulsive than girls. Because hyperactive and impulsive behaviours are more disruptive in the classroom, teachers are more likely to notice boys as a problem and refer them for attention challenges.Lastly, symptoms of ADHD in girls are sometimes masked because they work hard to meet adult expectations. Without meaning to, adults have different expectations of girls than boys. Adults expect girls to be tidy and organized, achieve good grades and to be easygoing. In turn, girls are more likely to want to obey social norms and not cause trouble. They will work extra hard to achieve success by staying up late to finish homework or tidying their rooms when asked.Sometimes, when adults encounter girls who have difficulty meeting their expectations but the girls are agreeable, they excuse the behaviours by describing the girls as ditzy, dramatic or artsy.There are many symptoms of ADHD shared by both boys and girls. The following are examples of how they can manifest in girls:If you think your daughter might have ADHD, you should consult with a psychologist or pediatrician who is familiar with ADHD and can provide an in-depth assessment.Meadow Schroeder is assistant professor of education at the University of Calgary.

They're working with the  to support a new parent education initiative, Flag Football Under 14, that pushes for no tackle football until the age of 14. I beg of you, all parents to please don't let your children play football until high school, said Buoniconti, 77, who has been diagnosed with dementia and probable chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a neurodegenerative disease.I made the mistake starting tackle football at 9 years old. Now, CTE has taken my life away. Youth tackle football is all risk with no reward.Buoniconti helped the Miami Dolphins to three straight Super Bowl appearances, including two wins and an undefeated season in 1972, the only such season in all of NFL history. In November, he said he intended to donate his brain to research. New York Giants legend Carson echoed Buoniconti's sentiments.I did not play tackle football until high school, I will not allow my grandson to play until 14, as I believe it is not an appropriate sport for young children, Carson said. Villapiano is best known for his big plays for the Oakland Raiders. He said that witnessing how CTE ravaged his  is causing him to speak out about the dangers of tackle football for children under 14.At some point, those of us who have had\u00a0success\u00a0in this game must speak up to protect both football players and the future of the game, and supporting 'Flag Football Under 14' is our best way to do that, he said.The players, along with researchers Chris Nowinski of the  and Dr. Robert Cantu and Dr. Lee Goldstein of Boston University, pointed to studies that showed CTE can start early in life and without any signs of concussion.  in the journal Brain came to that conclusion. It found some changes in the brain occurred as early as 24 hours after injury.Goldstein and his colleagues advocate for no tackle football before 14 because children's bodies, particularly their necks and upper bodies, aren't strong enough to counteract the bobbling of the head and shaking of the brain that occurs during tackles. , the director of neurosurgery and co-director of NorthShore University HealthSystem Neurological Institute and , said the concern over repeated hits is magnified in high school, after kids are 14.The real exposure to larger players, higher velocity hits and hundreds of hits starts in high school, he said. Goldstein said parents should heed the warning that CTE can develop early -- and the focus on concussions doesn't reduce the risk. The NFL is setting a bad example by focusing on the concussion and while not focusing on the hits, said Goldstein. The NFL and Dr. Allen Sills, it's chief medical officer, did not respond when asked whether the league is considering changing its CTE and concussion protocol because of the recent study. As highlighted in this recent study, repetitive\u00a0hits to the head have been consistently implicated as a cause of CTE by this research group. How and why exactly this manifests, who is at risk, and why -- these are questions that we as researchers and clinicians are working to answer, Sills said.  Sills noted changes the NFL has made to reduce head-to-head contact over the years, including limiting how much players can wear their helmets off-season and limiting full-padded practices during the season. The NFL has also made grants and supported brain science.Goldstein said concussions remain the red herring of CTE. We will never prevent CTE by focusing on concussions. Any meaningful prevention campaign has to focus on preventing all hits to the head, including sub-concussive impacts, said Goldstein.And one way to do that, he said, is to limit overall exposure to hits by waiting to play tackle football. Carson, the former linebacker, noted that the game is more popular now.Parents should understand exactly what they are signing their kids up for, he said.CNN's Kwegyirba Croffie contributed to this report."},
{"title": "A germ-free childhood could trigger leukemia, scientist suggests", "cate": "health", "content": "Germ-free childhoods followed by infections later in life can trigger the onset of childhood leukemia, a new study suggests., published Monday in the journal Nature Reviews Cancer, finds that acute lymphoblastic leukemia, the most common type of childhood cancer, is caused by a two-step process. The first step is a genetic mutation before birth that predisposes a child to the risk of developing this form of leukemia. The second step is exposure to certain infections later in childhood, after clean early childhoods that limited exposure to infections.More specifically, children who grew up in cleaner households during their first year and interacted less with other children are more likely to develop acute lymphoblastic leukemia, the paper says.The author, Institute of Cancer Research Professor Mel Greaves, suggests the cancer could be preventable.Greaves reviewed more than 30 years of research, including his own, on the genetics, cell biology, immunology, epidemiology and animal modeling of childhood leukemia and reached this conclusion. Greaves said he had long wondered why or how otherwise healthy children develop leukaemia and whether this cancer is preventable.This body of research is a culmination of decades of work, and at last provides a credible explanation for how the major type of childhood leukaemia develops, he said in a statement. The research strongly suggests that (this cancer) has a clear biological cause, and is triggered by a variety of infections in predisposed children whose immune systems have not been properly primed.However, other experts warn that more specifics needs to be confirmed and emphasize that hygiene and safety are still crucial., known as ALL, is a form of blood cancer that is most often diagnosed in children ages zero to 4 years old, though older children and adults can also be diagnosed. It develops quickly, over days or weeks, building up in the blood and spreads to other parts of the body, including the lymph nodes, liver and nervous system. The main form of treatment is chemotherapy.Rates of the disease are increasing globally.  estimated there were 53,000 cases worldwide in 2016. Around 5,960 new cases of ALL are  in the United States in 2018, with 1,470 deaths according to the American Cancer Society. Each year, around 810 people are , according to Cancer Research UK.While a genetic mutation plays a role in predisposing someone to the disease, just 1% of children born with this mutation go on to develop the disease, according to the paper. Rates are more common in advanced, affluent societies, which suggests the second step could be caused by factors relating to modern life. Previous claims have linked electromagnetic waves and other environmental factors to the disease, but Greaves dismissed this link in his paper.The body of research busts some persistent myths about the causes of leukaemia, such as the damaging but unsubstantiated claims that the disease is commonly caused by exposure to electro-magnetic waves or pollution, said Greaves.Greaves instead believes that when a baby is exposed to infections during its first year, its immune system is strengthened. But later infections, without the initial priming, can trigger leukemia in those with the genetic mutation.Population studies have found that early exposure to infection in infancy such as day care attendance and breastfeeding can protect against ALL, probably by priming the immune system, according to the study.Greaves emphasized that infection as a cause applies only to ALL. Other types of leukemia, including infant leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia, probably have different causal mechanisms.Preventing childhood leukaemia would have a huge impact on the lives of children and their families in the UK and across the globe, said Paul Workman, chief executive of the Institute of Cancer Research, London.However, other experts are more cautiously hopeful, emphasizing that genetics and pure chance are still significant factors for developing ALL.If we could stop this type of leukaemia from happening in the first place it would be enormously exciting, but many more questions still need to be answered in the research lab before we will know for sure whether that could become a reality, said Alasdair Rankin, director of research at blood cancer charity Bloodwise.There is no proven link yet with a specific infection, said Dr. Donna Lancaster, consultant pediatric oncologist at the Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust. This [new study] still needs further investigation and any exposure of young children to infection has to be balanced with the risk of the infection.Sheena Cruickshank of the British Society for Immunology also pointed to the potential risk of exposing children to infections, emphasizing that hygiene and safety are still crucial to maintain.It's also important to remember that infections themselves can pose a significant risk for young babies with a developing immune system, said Cruickshank in a statement. Parents should not be unduly alarmed by this review.The research may be a step toward developing preventative measures. However, Charles Swanton, chief clinician of Cancer Research UK, stressed that the causes and prevention methods are still unconfirmed.This research sheds light on how a form of childhood blood cancer might develop, implicating a complex combination of genetics and early exposure to germs, dirt, and illness, Swanton said. We want to assure any parents of a child who has or has had leukaemia, that there's nothing that we know of that could have been done to prevent their illness."},
{"title": "1 in 4 young people has been sexted, study finds", "cate": "health", "content": "Sexting among teens and younger children has increased over the past decade and poses a growing challenge for educators and parents, according to a . One in four young people said they'd received sexts, and one in seven reported sending them, according to the study, which was published Monday in the journal JAMA Pediatrics. The research included data from 39 separate research projects conducted between January 1990 and June 2016, with a total of 110,380 participants, all of whom were under 18 -- with some as young as 11. The researchers focused on data since 2008 and found an increase in sexting among young people. The increased number of young people involved in sending or receiving sexually explicit photographs or messages has corresponded with rapidly expanding access to cell phones.With that trend in mind, the study's authors suggest that age specific information on sexting and its potential consequences should regularly be provided as a component of sex education. The researchers found that younger people engage in sexting in large part as a way to begin exploring attraction to other people.As teens get older, we are going to see increasing numbers ... who sext. Just as we see with actual sexual behavior, said study co-author Jeff Temple, a professor of psychiatry at the University of Texas Medical Branch. It's not terribly surprising considering as teens age, their interest in sexuality is heightened. They are trying to figure out who they are.Kami Kosenko, a communications professor at North Carolina State University, agreed: As individuals become more comfortable talking about sex and interact with more potential sexual partners, we would expect to see them engage in more sexual communication, of which sexting is a part. Kosenko was not directly involved in the study.The study predicts a similar upward trend in sexting among younger teens and preteens. Coupled with a lack of awareness of the risks involved, especially among younger children, that is a cause for concern, the researchers said.Preteens can be particularly vulnerable to the pitfalls of sexting. Relationships among tweens (children 10 to 12) are often short-lived, and that makes individuals more vulnerable to having sexts forwarded without consent or being subject to sextortion: the use of nude images and or videos as a form of threat or blackmail.As tweens and kid smartphone ownership gets younger and younger, we are going to see an increase in the number of teens who are sexting, Temple said. On average, children in the study were 10.3 years old when they got their first smartphones. Danger also arises from messaging apps that give the impression that videos and images shared or stored are private, although this may not be the case. Teens can sometimes assume safety or security is embedded in these apps when it's not, said study co-author Sheri Madigan, an assistant professor in the Department of Psychology at the University of Calgary. Kids don't really have a clear understanding of cause and effect, Madigan said. When they send a picture, they may not recognize they cant get it back or that it is really up to the recipient to decide how they are going to treat that picture. Kosenko said that with youth acquiring cell phones at younger and younger ages, we should be concerned about their digital and physical safety.Part of the problem lies in the children's brains, Madigan said. Younger teens who have less developed frontal lobes are less able to think through things than older teens. They are likely more vulnerable to being coerced into sexting or to participate in nonconsensual sexting.There is little or no literature on tweens  and sexting, according to Madigan, who suggests that it is important to do further research on the topic. According to the study, 12.5% of young people -- or one out of every eight -- report that they have been forwarded a sext without consent from the sender and/or the receiver.That is why this concept of digital safety and security is so important: because we know that this is happening. We know that sexts are being forwarded without consent, so if parents are having conversations with their teens about sexting, they can talk about those potential risks, Madigan said.Nonconsensual sexting can take a toll on a teen's health.If we look at things like sexual behavior with teens, if it's consensual and both teens wanted it and are OK with it, you are not going to see the negative psychological health. If it was nonconsensual or coerced, that is where you see the negative mental health problems, and we see the same thing with sexting, Temple said. According to the study, further research needs to be conducted on nonconsensual sexting to appropriately target and inform intervention, education, and policy efforts.JAMA Pediatrics defines sexting as the sending or receiving of nude or seminude images or sexually explicit text messages. This can happen voluntarily in a relationship or when a teenager is asked to prove how much they like someone. It can also happen without consent.The biggest concern, according to the journal, is the possibility of photos or messages being spread to other people. Sexting can cause severe emotional distress, which is why it is important to talk with children about it. The researchers suggest:Being open and withholding judgment are keys to a successful interaction with a young person about sexting, Kosenko said.This means that demonizing sexting won't work. Also, don't assume that you are the expert on the subject or the one who should lead the discussion, she said.You might be tempted to tell your children to ask you if they have questions, but consider what can be gained by letting your children tell you what they know and think about sexting."},
{"title": "When your child vapes, what's a parent to do?", "cate": "health", "content": "When Sonya Kennedy learned that her 12-year-old son, Ryder, had tried vaping, she was mortified.He honestly didn't think that there was anything wrong, Kennedy said. He told me that almost all the grade-sevens were doing it.And she soon realized that the trend had reached many more kids in her orbit: Kennedy, who owns a dance studio in Northern California, found that most of her dancers had tried vaping, too. She learned that kids were vaping at school, taking puffs inside their shirts and in some cases charging their e-cigarettes in their teacher's own computer, she said. Meanwhile, many parents seemed oblivious.It's a bad habit that I started realizing parents didn't know about, she said. Health experts say parents whose kids are vaping often don't know what to do or where to turn for help. While federal authorities grapple with how to regulate e-cigarettes on a broad scale and while leading tobacco company Altria  in e-cigarette maker Juul, parents are scrambling at home to deal with nicotine dependence -- or to prevent their kids from getting hooked on something that's ubiquitous at many schools. Some are even approaching addiction rehab programs in hopes of weaning their kids off these products.It's all over social media, Kennedy said, and popular among star athletes in her community. As a mother, Kennedy said, she understands the role that peer pressure can play with fads like e-cigarettes. And as the mother of an athlete -- Ryder is an avid football and basketball player -- Kennedy said she knew that she had to do something. So she asked a local business to print a few T-shirts with a straightforward message: Athletes don't vape. She didn't know that it would catch on.Ryder called his mother the first day he wore the shirt to school, saying that some of his friends wanted their own. Kennedy also shared photos of the shirt on Facebook and received requests from people in Los Angeles, Sacramento and Canada who wanted in on the positive message. She even invited local athletes to a photo shoot and posted the results on  -- and they actually showed up on a Sunday morning, to her surprise.The response of the kids was what blew my mind, Kennedy said.Well over 500 shirts have been printed, she said; most have been given away in conjunction with Ryder's middle school and Kennedy's dance , and others continue to be sold at cost. Kennedy said her goal is to share a positive message and raise awareness among kids and parents alike.It can be frightening for some parents [and] anxiety-provoking for parents to realize that their kids are vaping, said Pat Aussem, a master addictions counselor with the  at the nonprofit Partnership for Drug-Free Kids. Aussem first tells overwhelmed parents, take a deep breath.The first thing parents can do is educate yourselves, said Meredith Berkman, who co-founded  last year when she realized the fad was hitting close to home -- literally.I kept hearing the window open, said Berkman, a mother of four in New York. I realized that this was going on in my house.E-cigarettes, which work by heating a liquid until it vaporizes, can be tough to spot because many look like USB drives and regular pens. The liquid commonly contains varying concentrations of nicotine, though some people use the devices to  or flavoring alone.Experts worry that e-cigarettes could put kids' developing brains at risk, get them hooked on nicotine early in life and be a gateway to smoking and other drugs -- but the long-term effects are unclear.In many cases, parents don't know that their kids are vaping, or they don't know what's in the vape, Aussem said. There are parents who know that their kids are vaping, but they assume it's harmless because they think, 'oh, it's flavoring. How bad can it be?' Experts also recommend that parents be familiar with signs their kids might be vaping: if they notice a faint, sweet scent, for example. Young e-cig users may also show a change in mood, take frequent breaks to take puffs and share vape-related posts on social media, according to experts.Parents can also model good behavior by not vaping or smoking tobacco themselves, according to the  And it's important to have an open conversation with your child -- listening over lecturing, experts say. It may also be helpful for parents to understand the reasons why their child might vape -- such as peer pressure, anxiety or avoiding symptoms of withdrawal -- in order to encourage healthier ways of addressing those needs, the Partnership says.Chances are that your child has at least heard of the most popular e-cigarette, Juul, according to  by Bonnie Halpern-Felsher, founder and executive director of the Halpern-Felsher said these conversations can go beyond simply telling kids that e-cigarettes are bad for them and setting clear expectations about drug use. Parents can also discuss how the devices have been  in such a way that appeals to youth, including ads, a vast social media presence and the variety of flavors they come in.Ashley Gould, chief administrative officer at Juul Labs, told CNN in June, We were completely surprised by the youth usage of the product. The company has maintained that its product is intended to convert adult former smokers to what Juul describes as a less-harmful alternative, and it says it is taking  to limit kids' use of e-cigarettes.It's been devastating to us, Gould said. This is not a product for youth.The company, which holds about 75% of the e-cigarette market in the United States, has also maintained that flavors are a useful tool to help adult smokers to switch from combustible cigarettes.Dr. Scott Gottlieb, commissioner of the US Food and Drug Administration, proposed in November to . These proposals could ultimately prompt their removal from shelves and websites that are accessible to minors. But the proposed changes do not include mint, menthol and tobacco flavors. Gottlieb said he wanted to leave the door open for adults who might use these products to quit smoking cigarettes, but it can't come at the expense of addicting a generation of kids on nicotine, he previously told CNN.Others have argued there's no conclusive evidence supporting this use of flavors.Who doesn't hope for harm reduction for adult smokers? asked Berkman, of Parents Against Vaping e-cigarettes. Despite what she calls a lack of convincing evidence that flavors are playing an instrumental role in adult cessation efforts, Berkman said, you do have concrete, direct  that the flavors are hooking the kids and that the flavors are keeping the kids from perceiving danger.Berkman, whose organization set up an e-mail  for parents to urge FDA regulations like banning e-cig flavors, says she isn't advocating banning the Juul altogether. But more has to be done -- and soon, she said.It's happening in real time, she said.When Dr. Sharon Levy, director of the Adolescent Substance Use and Addiction Program at Boston Children's Hospital, started receiving calls from parents across the country describing how e-cigarettes were affecting their children, I was extremely skeptical that the problem was from Juuling and nicotine use, she said.I was wondering, are they using other substances? Are they also using marijuana or something else? Or do they have mental health disorders? she said. I've actually seen enough local kids now to realize that some of these presentations look all the world like psychiatric presentations.Some of these teens come in with anxiety, distractability, headaches and stomachaches, symptoms Levy said were rarely seen with traditional cigarettes. In kids, nicotine addiction may look very different from adults, she added.Other symptoms may include increased thirst, nosebleeds and mood changes, according to the Partnership for Drug-Free Kids.Levy said that nearly all adolescents in her program have some experience with e-cigarettes, but what's new is that now, we're seeing patients in the substance use program whose only substance is nicotine.Kids are often really struggling with this, and there are just not a lot of resources for them, Levy said, adding that many addiction programs may not be equipped to deal with some of the younger, nicotine-addicted kids she's seeing. Far better would be to ensure that primary care doctors are equipped to work with kids in their own communities, Levy said.Some parents have pursued nicotine gum and other cessation tools for their children under doctors' guidance. Levy said that can be tricky because some kids may use these products as a bridge between puffs of vapes and tobacco products. There are no FDA-approved nicotine cessation products for e-cigarette users under 18, but the agency plans to hold a  to debate whether to approve smoking cessation drugs for kids in order to get them off vapes.Medications can be important in some advanced cases, but they're not enough, Levy said; kids also need good, solid counseling.We end up needing to teach kids how they can deal with cravings, how they can identify high-risk situations, how they can actually deal with being surrounded by people who are using these things, Levy said. Because the reality is that, for most kids, we treat them and put them back in school, and then they go to the bathroom, and everybody's Juuling.Aussem said parents can also use positive reinforcement to offer their kids something more interesting to them than vaping, and they can set negative consequences. But it's important to follow through, she added. For example, many parents might threaten to take their kids' phones away, only to return them a couple days later because it's difficult to reach them.Aussem also recommended , by the National Cancer Institute, which has a smartphone app and text messaging program geared toward teens. They may be more likely to quit than those who try without any assistance, she said.For many parents, she said, it's important to understand that there may be no quick fix.What's key, Aussem said, is to really think about, 'how am I going to intervene and really be willing to see this as a journey?'

{"title": "When is it really time for couples therapy?", "cate": "health", "content": "I'm often asked when couples should consider therapy. It's common for one partner to be unhappy, feel disconnected or feel that their needs for intimacy aren't being met. But rather than communicate about it, that partner may open up a metaphorical window with someone else and begin an affair. By the time the couple comes to therapy, the affair itself becomes the main topic, and its underlying causes are often ignored. The same scenario rings true for other sources of contention, from financial disagreements to sexual concerns. It's clear that couples shouldn't wait until they're in crisis mode to come to therapy, but what should they do? Couples should seek therapy long before they think they need to. Most experts believe that therapy can be an important part of your relationship. Most issues within a couple start small and then grow in size when they don't get resolved. This is where therapy can help, by giving tools and techniques to improve conflict resolution, explained Kristie Overstreet, a licensed mental health counselor. The majority of couples that I work with say that they should have started therapy years earlier. There are three sides to every story: his side, her side and the truth, psychotherapist Kimberly Resnick Anderson agreed. An objective third party can be just the ticket when couples feel they can no longer communicate effectively.Rather than viewing therapy as the solution to a crisis, look at it as an integral aspect of a healthy life, suggested Ashley N. Grinonneau-Denton, marriage and family therapist. Every couple should take preventive measures to maintain health in their relationship, just like going to the gym, she said. If couples don't work their relational and emotional 'muscles,' they become un-toned, weak and create more of a chance of damage being done to their relationship.Although every therapist is different, there are some commonalities. The first session typically involves the therapist getting to know you, discussing the areas of the relationship they hope to improve and setting goals. Some, but not all, therapists will assign homework for the couples to work on before the next session. Ideally, most of the work gets done, in my experience, outside of my office, psychotherapist Samantha Manewitz said. Couples come to therapy for any number of reasons, but in my experience, in addition to infidelity, the greatest issues include sex, communication, money and major life changes such as getting married or starting a family. Couples therapy is also a good idea if one of you is coping with an issue that might be affecting your relationship (such as depression) or simply if you're feeling stuck and stagnant in your relationship. Therapy can provide a safe space to talk about sensitive topics such as sex. Just like folks can get caught in a negative relational cycle, couples can often also get stuck in a negative sexual cycle, said Michael Moran, a certified sex therapist. I tell couples that when the sex they're having is worth having, they'll have more of it. And so we need to explore what blocks exist to creating that place between them.\u00a0Communication is also a big concern for couples. But simply talking with each other more isn't the answer. There is\u00a0communication,\u00a0and then there's effective communication, explained Sara Nasserzadeh, a psychologist. Both parties need to feel heard, soothed, respected and cared for first. We analyze old communication patterns and then replace them with feasible and more effective ones. These are all worked out collaboratively with the couple and within the context of their everyday life.\u00a0You might also consider couples therapy to help support you at times of major life change and transition. Getting married, becoming parents for the first time, moving, changing jobs, losing jobs, becoming empty-nesters, coping after extramarital affairs, recovering from addiction, caring for aging parents -- all of these transitions can destabilize a couple's equilibrium, Anderson said. Therapy affords couples an opportunity to negotiate these transitions with as little disruption as possible and to explore and honor what a particular transition means to each partner.And don't discount the value of couples therapy in helping you and your partner dig yourselves out of a rut. Therapy allows couples to talk through their feelings and articulate how their relationship may not be meeting their expectations, said James C. Wadley, a licensed counselor. More often than not, there is some common ground that may have enabled them to be in the relationship. 'Feeling stuck' can shift if both parties are willing to compromise in a way so that individual needs are met.\u00a0This is a fairly common scenario in couples therapy. How you approach it can make a difference. Talk with your partner extensively about why you're feeling you'd like to get into couples therapy, Moran said. Don't just spring it on them and insist they go.If they're still hesitant, remember that you can attend therapy on your own. This alone may have a beneficial effect. Instead of waiting for the other person who doesn't want to go to therapy to change, therapy can help strengthen your own self-improvement and personal growth, said Marissa Nelson, a marriage and family therapist. The hesitant partner may become impressed by these positive changes and decide to pursue therapy after all.If you think your own experiences with therapy have piqued your partner's curiosity, let them know that can see the therapist individually as well. Often, by letting them know a safety zone will be created, where their voice is heard and fault or blame isn't the goal, the hesitant partner might feel safe to come in, psychotherapist Constance DelGiudice explained.It helps to do your research before choosing a couples therapist, but the truth is that you won't really know whether they're the right for you and your partner until you get together. I often arrange a phone call first with clients to make sure we are potentially a good fit, Nasserzadeh said. Once you meet, pay attention to the therapist's communication style, the rational behind their questions and their general approach. Any\u00a0homework\u00a0they assign should be explained\u00a0clearly\u00a0and makes sense to you and your line of logic.\u00a0There's no one-size-fits-all answer to this question. It really depends on the couple and the issues they're working through. For some couples, a few sessions may be all they need to jump-start their relationship, while others may remain in therapy for years. In general, it's a good idea to see a therapist together until you've met your goals and feel confident that you've gained the skills necessary to navigate the ups and downs of your relationship."},
{"title": "What sets apart the 'Biggest Losers' who keep off the weight", "cate": "health", "content": "After competing in The Biggest Loser, many of the reality-show contestants have reluctantly regained the weight they sought to lose through extreme dieting and exercise. The truth is, I kind of spiraled, Ali Vincent, the first woman to win the competition,  I got home and I was like, 'What do I do?'I'm supposed to be strong. I'm supposed to know how to do this.But some contestants discovered for themselves the key to keeping their weight down long after the cameras turned off, according to Six years after appearing on the show, a group of 14 contestants had kept off a median 13% of their original body weight. The researchers split the group in two -- the maintainers, who had kept a substantial amount of the weight off,and the regainers, who did not -- and looked at what set them apart. Did they cut more calories from their diet ... or did they become more physically active? asked study author , a senior investigator with the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.Hall had been puzzled by how quickly the contestants were losing weight. So he contacted the show's physician and began studying the season eight contestants.Early on, Hall observed that weight loss was better predicted by food intake, not physical activity alone. But in the long term, the opposite was true.You have to be very physically active in order to keep the weight off, Hall said.The maintainers, who kept off about 25% of their preshow weight on average, increased their physical activity by roughly 160% from before the competition. Those who regained the weight increased their activity only 34%. They were 1.1% heavier on average than their original weight.The researchers couldn't find any major differences between the food intake of both groups; both cut their calories by about the same amount.While we know that the most important aspect of helping one lose weight is the dietary intake, that is pretty much reversed when it comes to weight loss maintenance, said , associate professor of medicine and public health sciences at the Penn State College of Medicine. She was not involved in the study.Hall's findings echo  that promote more exercise for long-term weight loss maintenance. However, experts caution that doesn't mean people can neglect their diets in the long run, either.To maintain the weight loss, Hall's team estimated that contestants would need to engage in 80 minutes of moderate activity or 35 minutes of vigorous activity each day beyond what they were doing at baseline. This is far beyond the leading guidelines for physical activity from groups like the  and the , which are far too low for maintaining weight loss, Hall said.The researchers didn't observe the contestants working out directly. They used tools like traceable water molecules to figure out how much energy was expended -- the gold standard measurements in this type of research, Kraschnewski said. Many larger studies have instead asked people to self-report how much they exercised, which can be riddled with errors.This method, however, was not able to tell how much of the physical activity was due to normal daily activities -- like cleaning the house or walking the dog -- versus following a workout plan, Hall said.Part of the reason the contestants' weight rebounded was because of metabolic slowing, Hall said. As contestants lost weight during the competition, their bodies burned fewer calories than expected.This can make it more difficult to lose weight and is another hurdle to overcome, Kraschnewski said. After going on a very low-calorie diet, the body's mechanisms kick in to preserve body mass at all costs.Six years later, however, the contestants' resting metabolisms still hadn't sped back up, Hall showed in This is a stark difference from people who have had gastric bypass surgery for weight loss, whose metabolisms may speed back up in a year's time, Kraschnewski said. Researchers are trying to figure out why this is -- and it may have something to do with the intricate connections between the gut, brain and hormones that regulate hunger, Kraschnewski added.For Hall, metabolic changes are just one part of the puzzle.  may also play a role, as well as social factors that can make it hard for some people to incorporate so much exercise in their daily lives.To do that requires a huge investment of time and energy, he said. The bar is set very high for those folks to be able to maintain the weight loss without surgery or drugs.Hall added that it's not necessarily those who were most physically active during the competition who kept it up six years later.You can't really reproduce the expectation that those individuals must have had on the show to lose weight -- the pressure, Kraschnewski said. The take-home point here is that obesity really is a disease, she said. It's not something that you can treat once and will cure it. It's something that has to be continually addressed in one's life."},
{"title": "Tackling the relentless pressure to succeed that's driving girls to despair", "cate": "health", "content": "As a mom of two daughters, I'm mindful of how girls today have more opportunity than ever. In fact, I tell my girls this all the time: They can be anything they want and shatter any glass ceiling, even the highest one, the presidency. Be confident and speak up, and you can achieve great things, we tell our girls. You can play any sport, join any after-school club, volunteer for any cause and get the grades. In fact, girls are regularly outperforming boys in school and enrolling in higher numbers in college.It's a great time to be a girl -- or is it? Because behind all these possibilities is a troubling development: Girls' anxiety and depression are climbing and increasingly turning tragic.Between 2007 and 2015, the suicide rate for girls between the ages of 15 and 19 doubled, reaching a 40-year high in 2015, according to I think no one can dispute the wholesale kind of collapse of girls' wellness right now, said bestselling author  who has been working with and doing research on girls for the past two decades.It's really a crisis. I don't think I'm overstating it. Everywhere I go, I hear about levels of anxiety that are so crippling that it makes it hard for teachers to teach, and we can't not pay attention to this anymore.Simmons points to the findings of a  by UCLA of 150,000 full-time students at more than 200 colleges and universities.Twice as many girls as boys reported that they felt depressed frequently or occasionally, and twice as many girls as boys said they were overwhelmed with all they had to do -- a 25% jump in the number of girls in both categories in just over 15 years, according to Simmons.What's behind these concerning numbers? As Simmons writes in her new book,  girls are growing up with outsize expectations of personal and professional success. The pressure to be great at everything is causing them to feel less confident, more fearful of failure and more critical of themselves, Simmons says.There is a deep mismatch in terms of what the culture is telling girls and their most vulnerable parts of their psychology, said Simmons, who is also co-founder of the national nonprofit Girls are socialized at a very young age to rely heavily on feedback from others. They grow up paying more and more attention to what other people think of them and whether they are measuring up to those external expectations.In today's society, that relentless concern about pleasing others is on what Simmons calls a collision course with two cultural changes: the ubiquitousness of social media, which is exacerbating the need to perform, and heightened expectations of what it means to be a successful girl today.We're now giving girls access to STEM (science, technology, engineering and math). We're giving girls access to opportunities they've never had before. And we're not doing that and saying, 'Oh, you don't have to have a bikini body anymore. That's cool. You're good. You can look however you want to look,'  Simmons said. No, we're saying 'keep your bikini body and become an engineering major and also have a totally lit Snapchat feed on a Saturday night,' and so that's exhausting, and I call that role overload and role conflict.Social media alone becomes a virtual second shift for young girls, almost like a full-time job, as they spend more time on averageon Instagram and Snapchat that boys do.Social media enables them to curate an exhausting range of identities -- jock, scholar, beauty queen, party girl, best friend, and on and on -- demanded by the new rules of girl success, crammed into a twenty-four-hour day, she writes in Enough As She Is.Simmons said she wishes she didn't have to write this book. In her bestseller  published in 2009, she wrote about the need to teach girls how to take up space, find courage and be confident. But in her work with girls on college campuses and elementary, middle and high schools across the country, she started to see that the wellness piece was missing.Despite very high levels of achievement, girls were struggling with a sense of imposter syndrome, low lack of confidence, overthinking and an enduring belief that no matter how hard they tried, they were not enough of whatever it was, said Simmons, who has a young daughter of her own. Moreover, the terms of success that they had established for themselves were so kind of outsized and unrealistic and unhealthy that they were on this hamster wheel of trying to get something they were never going to get.Simmons said she has come to realize that in order to help girls become stronger and more confident, we have to attend to their emotional health. We never thought about girls' leadership as being integrated into their wellness, and ... that's the shift that's taking place, is that we need to start thinking about wellness in tandem with growing their confidence and growing their achievement., head of school at The Hewitt School, a girls' private school in New York City, and a former dean at Princeton University, said that what she and her colleagues in higher education have seen across college campuses for years are young girls with amazing ... paper resumes with all the right grades and SAT scores. It looks amazing on paper, and yet the interior life of young women in particular was sorely lacking, said Kinsey, who has a daughter in the third grade and a son in the fifth grade. She tells the story of meeting with a female college student when her then-5-year-old daughter burst through the office door, so excited to show her mom the contents of her kindergarten folder. When her daughter left, the young woman looked at me, and she said, 'I remember when I used to have that kind of confidence.'  As an educator and an advocate for girls and women, Kinsey said, she is focused on the gap between what we know girls need to thrive and be healthy and how we're teaching them every day, whether it's in the classroom or in the home.I think that better understanding that gap holds many of the keys to closing yet another gap, the success gap between how girls are faring in school -- where we know they're crushing it, and they're outperforming boys, and they're achieving at levels we've never seen before -- and how they're faring in life after school, Kinsey said. They're coming up against not only a structural glass ceiling but also a psychological glass ceiling that thwarts their self-actualization.Kinsey was familiar with Simmons' books and incorporated her research into her work in higher education. When she moved to The Hewitt School, she wanted to bring Simmons' teachings and experience to students, faculty and parents in the community. In 2016, Simmons was named the inaugural Girls' Research Scholar in Residence at Hewitt.Simmons' work at Hewitt involves helping the girls and young women build their skills in the broad category of emotional intelligence, Kinsey said, with a focus on healthy risk-taking, conflict resolution, self-advocacy, managing friendships, and the giving and receiving of feedback.She may be sprawled on the floor with an entire grade of middle-schoolers, tracing their bodies for an exercise on the difference between feelings you sometimes keep inside, such as jealousy, and feelings you express, such as anger. She might be sitting crisscross apple sauce with elementary school girls, talking about the difference between a real apology and a not-so-real apology.Or she may be standing on a chair and reciting a poem demonstrating how the pressure to be perfect really undermines the ability to give and receive authentic feedback.What I'm trying to do is fill in the blanks in terms of some of the skills that they don't have, Simmons said. So, sure, they're really good at doing their worksheets and the homework and sitting quietly in class discussions and taking exams, but when something goes off the rails, then we're working with them on, how do you cope? We're filling in the blanks, and I contend that if you fill in the blanks ...then we're going to see a better balance between all of this ... on-paper success and what's happening inside.But right now, things are out of whack. We got overdeveloped on paper and very underdeveloped in life and in terms of resilience (and) adaptability.It is that fear of failure that can really be crippling for girls and young women today, which is why Simmons, who is also a leadership development specialist at Smith College, regularly concludes her orientation programs on college campuses with a graduation ceremony. The young women who attend will each receive a Certificate of Failure.The mock diploma reads, Having honorably fulfilled all the requirements imposed by the overload of high school, you are hereby certified to screw up, bomb or otherwise fail during college and still be a totally worthy, utterly excellent human, Simmons writes in her book.The girls laugh, she writes, but then they take those certificates back to their dorm rooms. Every girls needs a Certificate of Failure, she writes.At Hewitt, Simmons also works with the teachers, helping them see the importance of trying to teach soft skills such as resilience and adaptability just like they are teaching anything else.Instead of giving feedback on written work, a teacher might do a one-on-one consultation with the student in which they focus on her goals and what she hopes to achieve in her next writing sample. In math, teachers don't typically give girls grades on quizzes; they give written feedback so the girls can learn from their mistakes. You see how that's just completely transformative to girls and relationships, to their own achievement, Kinsey said. It's not about grades. It's about growth. It's about feedback. It's about failure. It's about honoring mistakes as a necessary part of the learning process.As part of her work at Hewitt, Simmons also meets regularly with parents and tries to help them combat the sense of shame and 'not-enoughness' that so many parents have.This is an era in which parents are probably the least confident they're ever been in themselves, Simmons said. If we want our kids to feel like they are enough, the parents have to feel like they are enough.During coffee talks, she tries to help parents feel comfortable enough to share what they are most afraid of, such as concerns that their daughter doesn't have a ton of friends or isn't getting the best grades.We had a couple of faculty members who aren't parents who were sitting there going, 'Oh, my God. I had no idea that parents were that scared about their kids, and all I see is 'my daughter didn't get a good grade on the test,' and that anger is actually fear,' Kinsey said. That anger is fear, and what Rachel is doing in such a beautiful way is saying ''if you don't get in touch with that, you're not really modeling for girls what they need.' Muffy Flouret, who has a daughter in the seventh grade at Hewitt, said Simmons is helping students and parents understand what it means to fail and how to bounce back. She's on the edge of the research of how do we raise girls in the community, and it's invaluable, because parents who might not think twice about saying, 'Well, you didn't get the A. I'm not so happy about that,' might now think twice about that reaction, Flouret said.She also saidSimmons is helping the community understand the perils of trying to be the best at everything.To create this sort of pressure that you have to be the top of the soccer team and you have to be top of the debate team, it's not sustainable, and it's not realistic, she said. Where does that leave you as an adult? You have to be able to bounce back and react to things.Jo-Anne Williams, co-chairwoman of the Hewitt Parents' Association, who has a daughter in the seventh grade at the school, attends nearly every one of Simmons' events with parents. It really causes you to take a step back and say, 'What am I really doing? Am I just trying to create a cookie cutter of myself, or (what) I want her to be?'  Williams said. I worked in finance. I was always strong in certain subjects that she doesn't happen to like all that much. Am I pressuring her too much on math because that's not her thing? She's a dancer. She's a great writer. She's other things.Williams said her daughter recently told her mother that she chews her fingernails because she's a perfectionist.I said, 'Well, I used to chew my fingernails when I was a kid,' and I said, 'I stopped doing it. And I also used to be a perfectionist and I've stopped doing that, so there's hope for you.' "},
{"title": "Ways to make someone feel loved, besides saying it ", "cate": "health", "content": "We say it before we end a phone call. We type it in our texts. It's the last words we speak before we say good night. I love you is possibly the most popular three-word phrase in the world, spoken millions of times every day. I love you translates intimacy between ourselves and others, but the expression is so common that it can lack the meaning it's intended. When saying and hearing it becomes automatic and expected, its power becomes dulled in our brain's limbic system, where we process love. Psychologist Abraham Maslow created a hierarchy of needs that ranks what humans are motivated to achieve, with love cited as a basic need after safety, food and shelter. A human's need for love carries a weight within us that isn't always an emotion. It can be an overall warmth, a deep sense of belonging, an underlying connectedness or confirmation of adoration between people. Still how do we arrive at a loving state?Researchers from Penn State University found that feeling loved isn't just about saying or hearing I love you. Feeling loved is often conveyed through small gestures. According to a recent study, when it comes to transmitting that loving feeling. It is possible for people to feel loved in simple, everyday scenarios, explained the study's lead researcher, Zita Oravecz. It doesn't have to be over-the-top gestures. Here are easy and effective ways to communicate I love you. Gifts are common enough that they can become as generic an exchange as I love you -- but not if you consider the receiver and tailor it to them. A sense of humor helps, too. Author Sue Shapiro suggests, Instead of flowers or candy (which don't do anything for me), my husband will bring me a ream of paper and a little bottle of Wite-Out when he knows I have a deadline. True love! And I feel like someone actually knows me. Make someone's favorite dessert just because, or give a freezable dinner to a busy friend. One study found evidence that offering food is seen as  and sharing food an indicator of love. Take that a step further, and you could say cooking for others can be viewed as a nurturing, altruistic act that comes with the benefit of , according to one study. Making food as way to express love, explained dating expert and author James Michael Sama, brings people together in gatherings and celebrations, and can be used as a bonding experience with cooking and sharing. This combination of doing an altruistic, creative act while fulfilling someone's need to eat is mutually good for well being and feeling loved. Cozy up. Researchers recruited nearly 500 Americans to answer a questionnaire featuring 60 common interactions and explain whether those activities . A child snuggling up to you received 97% consensus on a hypothetical action that would make them feel loved. Besides boosting loving feelings,  and boosts immunity, according to one study. We often reach out to wish someone a happy birthday, arrange plans or ask for help. Try contacting someone to ask how they are or simply to chat. Doing so has the potential to produce tenderness. More than 90% of that questionnaire's participants agreed that someone calling to check in out of the blue made them feel loved.Put away the dishes from the dishwasher. Fold the laundry without being asked. Pick up milk from the store. Relieving someone's burden, even a minor one, demonstrates care. Try to pinpoint the small things someone does for you that warms your heart, said Saeideh Heshmati, a co-author of the Penn State study and a postdoctoral research scholar there. Once you find those little things, try to savor them and preserve that feeling. As you're aware, you're more prone to perceive them as love. "},
{"title": "Looking at children's programming through a #MeToo lens ", "cate": "health", "content": "We are all familiar with the negative images of girls and women in movies and other media -- and how ubiquitous they are.From the physical portrayal of women as ultra-thin, super sexy and scantily clad to the sexualized roles they often play, it's enough to make you wish you could put your daughters in a bubble to shield them.Of course, you can't. Even that Prince Charming narrative, in which their lives are not complete until they meet the right guy and that guy decides to love them in return, is everywhere.But what about the positive role models our girls are seeing? Certainly, the #MeToo movement has called attention to the need to create more substantial roles for women of all ages on the big and small screens and to get more women behind the scenes in director and screenwriting roles.Even before the past six months when women's voices have been heard in ways they haven't been before, there were signs -- exciting signs -- of shifting portrayals of young women, even in children's programming.Research shows that kids develop stereotypes at early ages. A  of more than 150 articles, interviews and books and other research found that kids between the ages of 7 and 10 start to attribute certain qualities to women and men, such as that women are emotional and men are aggressive.Let me say that one more time. Between 7 and 10. Helping young girls and boys during these ages see realistic portraits of girls and boys can have enormous benefits, which brings me to Disney Channel's No. 1 show in video on demand. The show just wrapped its second season and has been renewed for a third.Think about the storyline, which is uncharted territory for mainstream children's programming: The main character, Andi, learns that the person she thought was her older sister for 13 years is actually her mother and that the two people she thought were her parents are actually her grandparents. Andi grapples with these life-changing circumstances with the support of her two best friends: the gender-stereotype-bashing Buffy, who believes she is as strong -- or stronger -- than any of the boys, and Cyrus, who has only recently shared with his friends that he is gay.My girls, ages 10 and 11, and I watch the show -- together -- every Friday night. We recently had a chance to sit down with the show's creator and three of its stars.TerrI Minksy, the creator and executive producer of Andi Mack, wanted to create a show that mothers could watch with their daughters. She said she didn't create the characters with female empowerment in mind but very much was focused on the point of view of the girl, because girlhood is when girls begin to get a sense of their own power or lack thereof.There's always this 'you can grow up to be whatever you want,' but we haven't seen a female president in the United States. We don't see female faces when you're looking at anything where decisions are being made, said Minsky, who made the pilot with a predominantly female team.I just feel like it has to start with the kids as represented in the shows as having the power over their world, and hopefully that translates to people watching it without specifically calling it female power.Sofia Wylie plays Buffy, who tries out for and makes the boys' basketball team (she also ends up tutoring the captain of the team). Sofia, 14, believes that her character can serve as an empowering role model to girls who watch.I would definitely say Buffy sends a message that a girl can do anything a boy can do and there's really no difference, said Sofia, also an accomplished dancer who has performed on stage with Justin Bieber and on America's Got Talent.So many people say, 'Oh, yeah, boys are just like stronger,' and when a boy says that, I'm going to contain myself now, she says to laughter as she indicates how frustrated that statement makes her feel. It's not true. If a woman wants to put their mind to something, they can be just as intelligent and just as strong physically and mentally in every way. They can be even better than a man.Even today, in 2018, a woman who is competitive -- especially in the workplace -- may be viewed differently than a man. A man may be considered assertive, a woman aggressive. Sofia says her character tackles that double standard as well.People think if you're competitive, that means you're mean, she said. No, she's competitive for a separate reason, because she's been told that she has to be strong. In one episode, we learn that Buffy feels she needs to always be strong to help her cope when her mom, who is in the military, is away during months-long deployments.One of the recurring storylines that also tackles gender stereotypes head-on is Andi's crush on the handsome, athletic and very popular Jonah Beck. During season one and the first half of season two, Andi is basically obsessed with Jonah. At some point, it appears they may actually be boyfriend and girlfriend in the way 13-year-olds innocently begin relationships. She makes him a bracelet. She beams when she sees him. But he never seems to truly understand Andi and never does for Andi all the things she does for him.And then, Andi has had enough. With the support of her friends Buffy and Cyrus and her mom, Bex, she finally decides to tell Jonah that she has been obsessed with him and that she can no longer continue doing what she has been doing. It is the moment when, I would argue, many women watching (and many who have experienced #MeToo moments) ask themselves, Why didn't I say that when I was in a similar situation? Lilan Bowden, who plays Bex, Andi's independent and individualistic mother, says she wishes she had Andi Mack when she was a girl. Instead, the shows she watched all repeated the same story line: The girl has a crush on the boy, the boy finally says he likes her back, and they get together.That was the message that I felt like I received over and over again: Just do the nice thing. If you're nice and you keep being nice and you don't stop being nice, eventually, you'll get what you want, Bowden said. And to have that character to say, 'I was nice, and you didn't appreciate it because you're not nice enough back to me' was huge.Minsky said the episode was written more as a natural progression of Andi's character and less in response to the #MeToo movement. When Andi expresses herself to Jonah, she's the one who is in charge for the first time, said Minsky, who also created Lizzie McGuire, a live-action and animated series that was also a Disney Channel hit. It's always the girl giving and embarrassing herself and putting herself out there and taking chances, and the boy's sitting back, and you don't know how he feels ... and then she finally expresses herself, and he's like 'Oh, wow, I really enjoy that you're obsessed with me,' and I kind of feel, 'yeah, I bet you did.'  (In another sign of the show's relatable nature, it tackles anxiety when Jonah has a panic attack after Andi tells him she is moving on.)Peyton Elizabeth Lee, who plays Andi, said she, Sofia and Bowden cheered when they read that episode because it was a sign that Andi was finally finding her voice.Because she's just been so caught up in 'Jonah's cute, and he's fun, and he has so many friends, and he's popular, and he's athletic and whatever,' but when it really comes down to it, he wasn't giving her enough credit for everything she was doing for him, said Peyton, 13, who has appeared on ABC's Scandal and Shameless on Showtime.I think she was realizing that she's worth more, so it was a really exciting thing ... where she's saying 'I was obsessed with you,' and it's Andi realizing that she doesn't need him to feel complete.There is no question that we need to see more realistic and authentic female characters on television and in film. Research commissioned by the  in 2014 shows how far we need to go. It found that the percentage of female characters in the work force in TV and film was less than 25%, when women make up just about half of the actual work force. Fictional male judges and lawyers outnumbered  in those same roles 13 to 1; the breakdown of men to women was 7.6 to 1 when it came to characters in computer science and engineering.We know that when you see it, you can be it. In a survey of 1,000 women in the United States and the United Kingdom, conducted by the Davis Institute and J. Walter Thompson and unveiled in 2017, 71% of respondents in the US and 63% in the UK said that if we saw more corporate leader characters who were women, it would make it easier for women to become leaders in the corporate sector. of respondents in the US and the UK said that seeing more female characters as politicians would make it easier for women to succeed in politics. Bowden, who also regularly performs improv and sketch comedy, hopes shows like Andi Mack are a marker for what is to come. When she got to Hollywood and was auditioning, there was a very limited selection of roles for women, she said. It's almost like a paying of dues where ... you're pretty much just the eye candy, she said. I didn't want to be a model. I wanted to be an actor, but there's so many roles that are written for women where they just kind of pigeonhole you into being a model.This show is all these dynamic female characters that aren't relying on beauty at all, and that's not an experience I felt like I had when I was first auditioning, she said. With , having strong female early-teenage role models who speak truthfully and aren't afraid to stand up for what they believe can only be a positive.I think you can take so many things away (from the show) but just being confident in yourself, Sofia told my daughters. I think that's the best thing about all of our characters is, we're all ourselves.Added Peyton, A lot of shows showcase if you're just nicer, it all works out. If you're nice, you get friends. You have a boyfriend, but it's just not like that, and you have to find that balance of being nice, but being careful. ... You have to figure out which way you want to go."},
{"title": "Where fat goes when you lose weight", "cate": "health", "content": "The world is obsessed with fad diets and weight loss, yet few of us know how a kilogram of fat actually vanishes off the scales.Even the 150 doctors, dietitians and personal trainers we surveyed shared this surprising . The most common misconception by far, was that fat is converted to energy. The problem with this theory is that it violates the law of conservation of matter, which all chemical reactions obey.Some respondents thought fat turns into muscle, which is impossible, and others assumed it escapes via the colon. Only three of our respondents gave the right answer, which means 98% of the health professionals in our survey could not explain how weight loss works.So if not energy, muscles or the loo, where does fat go?The correct answer is that fat is converted to carbon dioxide and water. You exhale the carbon dioxide and the water mixes into your circulation until it's lost as urine or sweat.If you lose 10 pounds of fat, precisely 8.4 pounds comes out through your lungs and the remaining 1.6 pounds turns into water. In other words, nearly all the weight we lose is exhaled.This surprises just about everyone, but actually, almost everything we eat comes back out via the lungs. Every carbohydrate you digest and nearly all the fats are converted to carbon dioxide and water. The same goes for alcohol.Protein shares the same fate, except for the small part that turns into urea and other solids, which you excrete as urine.The only thing in food that makes it to your colon undigested and intact is dietary fibre (think corn). Everything else you swallow is absorbed into your bloodstream and organs and, after that, it's not going anywhere until you've vaporised it.We all learn that energy in equals energy out in high school. But energy is a notoriously confusing concept, even among health professionals and .The reason we gain or lose weight is much less mysterious if we keep track of all the kilograms, too, not just those enigmatic kilojoules or calories.According to the latest government figures, Americans consume 3.55 kg (125 ounces) of food and beverages every day. Of that, 430 grams (about 15 ounces) is , 17 grams (0.6 ounces) is fibre and the remaining 3.11 kg (110 ounces) .What's not reported is that we inhale more than 660 grams (23 ounces) worth of oxygen, too, and this figure is equally important for your waistline.If you put 3.55 kg (125 ounces) of food and water into your body, plus 660 grams of oxygen (23 ounces), then 4.2 kg (148 ounces) of stuff needs to come back out, or you'll gain weight. If you're hoping to shed some weight, more than 4.1kg will have to go.The 430 grams (15.2 ounces) of carbohydrates, fats, protein and alcohol most Americans eat every day will produce exactly 770 grams (27.1 ounces) of carbon dioxide plus 290 grams (10.2 ounces) of water (about one cup) and about 31 grams (1.1 ounces) of urea and other solids excreted as urine.An average 75kg (165 pound) person's resting metabolic rate (the rate at which the body uses energy when the person isn't moving) produces about 590 grams (21 ounces) of carbon dioxide per day. No pill or potion you can buy will increase that figure, despite the bold claims you might have heard.The good news is that you exhale 200 grams (7 ounces) of carbon dioxide while you're fast asleep every night, so you've already breathed out a quarter of your daily target before you even step out of bed.So if fat turns into carbon dioxide, could simply breathing more make you lose weight? Unfortunately not. Huffing and puffing more than you need to is called hyperventilation and will only make you dizzy, or possibly faint. The only way you can consciously increase the amount of carbon dioxide your body is producing is by moving your muscles.But here's some more good news. Simply standing up and getting dressed more than doubles your metabolic rate. In other words, if you simply tried on all your outfits for 24 hours, you'd exhale more than 1,200 grams (42 ounces) of carbon dioxide.More realistically, going for a walk triples your metabolic rate, and so will .Metabolising 100 ounces of fat consumes 290 ounces of oxygen and produces 280 ounces of carbon dioxide plus 110 ounces of water. The food you eat can't change these figures.Therefore, to lose 100 ounces of fat, you have to exhale 280 ounces of carbon dioxide on top of what you'll produce by vaporising all your food, no matter what you eat.Any diet that supplies less fuel than you burn will do the trick, but with so many misconceptions about how weight loss works, few of us know why.Ruben Meerman is an assistant scientist at the University of New South Wales and author of Big Fat Myths: When You Lose Weight, Where Does the Fat Go?

{"title": "Why intense workouts are leading to a life-threatening condition", "cate": "health", "content": "When Christopher Michael Everett went to his first SoulCycle class, he gave it his all. He sat in the front of the class, cranked the resistance on his bike and started pedaling. Within the first five to 10 minutes, his thighs began to hurt and feel abnormal. But he powered through the pain and stuck it out until the end of the class. They say go big or go home. I probably should have went home, said Everett, a 33-year-old actor in Los Angeles.For the rest of the day, he felt OK, but the following night was marred by excruciating thigh pain. Unable to sleep, he searched for Spin class and sore legs and came across written by a woman who needed to go to the hospital after a cycling class for a condition called rhabdomyolysis.Rhabdomyolysis leads muscle tissue to break down and release a harmful protein into the bloodstream. Everett recognized the symptoms she mentioned, such as soreness, swollen thighs, nausea and an inability to bend the knees. He had all of them except , which he was not about to wait for, he said. Everett immediately went to the ER and was diagnosed with rhabdomyolysis. He stayed in the hospital for a week. Rhabdomyolysis quite literally means breakdown of muscle, said Dr. Derek Fine, associate professor of medicine and interim chief of nephrology at Johns Hopkins Medicine. When the muscle breaks down, it releases myoglobin, a protein that can poison the kidneys, into the bloodstream. The condition is caused by any type of trauma to the muscle. There are also toxins in some medications and illicit drugs that can cause it, he said. The first descriptions of the condition were among people who had been trapped under bombed buildings during World War II, Fine said.Recently, strenuous exercise has been popping up as another common culprit, seen in people who do activities like Spinning, P90X, CrossFit, weightlifting and running.I've had patients come in who can't walk. They can't get out of bed. They call 911 because their muscles don't work, Fine said. In rhabdomyolysis cases that are easier to treat, the patient is given fluids to rehydrate and released from the hospital after a few days of monitoring, Fine said. Everett said he was hooked up to an IV and pumped with fluids for seven days to flush out the toxins in his kidneys. He was not released until his levels of CPK -- creatine phosphokinase, an enzyme that leaks into the blood when muscle tissue is damaged -- were normal.If the condition is really severe, the kidneys may shut down, and the patient could end up on dialysis. With kidney failure comes the risk of an overload of potassium in the body, which could lead to abnormal heart rhythms and death. In April,  on three cases of rhabdomyolysis that were caused by Spinning classes. In one case, a 33-year-old kindergarten teacher was put on dialysis when she had kidney failure and experienced fluid overload from her hydration treatment.It's tough to tell somebody who's 33 years old, 'I need to start you on dialysis.' And so you treat them with a lot of fluids, and you hopefully get them to the point where their kidneys open up and they start getting rid of the toxins and they don't have to go on dialysis, said Dr. Alan Coffino, a nephrologist and chairman of medicine at Northern Westchester Hospital in New York and a co-author of the study. He treated the 33-year-old. In her case, we had to pull the plug and put her on dialysis.  After two weeks, her kidneys opened up, and she was released from the hospital.Another potential symptom of rhabdomyolysis is compartment syndrome, Coffino said, which is when muscles swell and are unable to expand. In some cases, surgery is needed to release pressure from the muscle. Everett said the swelling of his thighs concerned the doctor. He was like, 'if your thighs get any more swollen, we're going to have to cut those open,'  he said. But the swelling did not increase, and Everett was able to avoid surgery.People who work out regularly can get rhabdomyolysis, Coffino said, as well as those who don't exercise often. Those who are fit typically get it if they push themselves too hard or if they try a new exercise that works a different muscle group. The study he co-authored points out that of the 46 people documented in medical literature who got rhabdomyolysis from a Spin class, 42 developed it after their first class.Everett worked out every two to three days and considers himself fit, but he had never taken a Spin class before. I just wish SoulCycle would have said at the beginning of the class, 'if you work out too hard, this can happen to you,'  Everett said. Its been one month since he was hospitalized, and his legs are still sore.SoulCycle has not responded to requests for comment.Although any type of extreme exercise can lead to the condition, the popularity of Spinning is what concerns Dr. Maureen Brogan, associate professor of medicine at New York Medical College, nephrologist at Westchester Medical Center and the lead author of the study.I mean, Spinning, you burn 600 calories in an hour, and you lose up to a liter an hour of sweat, Brogan said. Six hundred calories is like running six miles. So if you're not conditioned, you wouldn't just run six miles.One of her patients developed rhabdomyolysis after spending only 15 minutes on a bike.Rhabdomyolysis can occur at any age and in both men and women. In Brogan's Spinning study, it was more common in females, but that's because more women tend to participate in the exercise, she said.To avoid the condition, it is important to be slow and gradual when beginning a new type of workout, she said. When going to a class, you should tell the instructor if you are new, and make sure to hydrate before, during and after exercising.Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications can be damaging to the kidneys, so they shouldn't be taken after an intense workout, Brogan said. If someone does develop rhabdomyolysis, it could worsen their condition. It's better just to err on the side of caution and take things slowly, Brogan said."},

When he wasn't traveling for work as a salesman for GE, the 51-year-old rarely left his San Jose, California, apartment. He took insulin for type 2 diabetes and about 15 other medications, including anti-depressants and weight-loss drugs. My entire life was an exercise in minimizing my movement. I just felt miserable all the time, O'Grey told CNN. It's just amazing how painful it is to be that heavy. Every part of your body hurts. My cholesterol was 400, which is the walking dead level.  He tried dieting, but nothing worked. Then two things happened seven years ago that inspired him to go see a .O'Grey had an embarrassing incident on a plane when the flight crew had to wait for a seat belt extension for him before taking off. And he saw former President Bill Clinton on the news talking about his new plant-based diet. The doctor recommended a  like Clinton's.  She told O'Grey to throw out everything in his pantry that wasn't on her list. But she also said something that shocked him. She ordered him to adopt a shelter dog and walk him twice a day for 30 minutes.  I said, 'Why a dog? Can I adopt a cat instead?' She said, 'Have you ever walked a cat?'Eric went home armed with new recipes and an order to visit his local animal shelter. He went to the shelter with visions of the perfect dog dancing through his head, one that never barked or shed or disobeyed commands.And then the adoption coordinator brought in an obese dog with skin problems. His head was hung low and he wasn't even looking up. He was just obviously depressed, O'Grey said. The dog looked up at me with a clear sense of disappointment I'd never seen on any person or creature.The adoption coordinator told him they had a lot in common and both needed to work on the same things. 'You told me you want to lose weight and get outside more, she said. This dog needs the same thing. So this is the dog that I am recommending for you.O'Grey took the dog home and named him Peety after the pup in The Little Rascals. And they began going on walks.At first, O'Grey could only take his new sidekick about 100 yards before he'd turn back, huffing and puffing and embarrassed. But Peety seemed to like it.He just looked up at me like he was so appreciative. Their twice-daily walks gradually got longer as Eric began to enjoy his strolls through a neighborhood he'd never explored on foot before. And Peety, with his striking white and black markings, was a great conversation starter. I called him my weapon of mass seduction because everybody wanted to meet him, O'Grey said. We would walk around town and these women would say, 'Hey, do you mind if I pet your dog?' As they lost weight and grew healthier together, the pair developed a tight bond. I decided to become the person who he thought that I was. And over time really every part of my life improved, O'Grey said. I was so reclusive and removed from society at the time that I needed a relationship in my life. It turned on certain emotions in me that I'd never really felt before.In less than six months, Eric quit all the medications he was taking. He barely knew how to boil water, but he learned how to cook the spicy, vegetarian recipes his naturopathic doctor gave him.I really began liking my new foods much better than my old foods, he said. My palate changed entirely and I started craving spicy foods. And in 10 months, he dropped from 340 pounds to 185 pounds. Eric began going on dates for the first time in 15 years. He had so much extra energy with his leaner body and healthier diet that he joined a club of runners. I was bouncing off the walls, I just had more energy than I could handle, he said.Over time O'Grey discovered that he loved long-distance running. Today he runs an average of five to six marathons a year. But he's quick to emphasize that his weight loss didn't come from running. Healthy eating and two walks a day with Peety did that.  In March 2015, Peety died of cancer. O'Grey calls it the the saddest day of my life.Today O'Grey lives in Boise, Idaho, where he cooks up dishes like vegetarian paella with purple carrots and marinated tofu. His kitchen has large bins of exotic spices. He is an evangelist for three things: cooking with fresh veggies and lots of spices, long-distance running and dog adoption.  Five months after Peety died, he found solace by adopting a new exercise buddy.  Jake, with his shiny black coat, lean frame and boundless energy, is a good match for the new, healthy Eric. Last year O'Grey rekindled a relationship with his high school sweetheart and got married. It's been seven years since he started his journey toward a healthier, happier life. He is 58 years old but he says he feels more like 25. He's co-written a book, And for others struggling with obesity, Eric offers this encouragement. It's never too late to turn it around, he said.

{"title": "How to lose your love handles", "cate": "health", "content": "If you ask almost any fitness professional how to lose your love handles, they will tell you two things: No amount of abdominal crunches will make a difference if you don't first improve your diet and exercise regimen. And there is no such thing as spot reducing when it comes to fat loss, so you can't target this area alone. Love handles, the pinchable fat on both sides of your stomach that leads to a muffin top appearance, are especially stubborn. They do not respond as quickly to diet and exercise changes as the more dangerous visceral fat that is deep within your abdomen and leads to more of a potbelly appearance. If you are a woman and your waist is larger than 35 inches around or a man with a waist size greater than 40 inches, you will lose the deep belly fat first. This is actually better for your health, as visceral fat has been linked to numerous medical issues, including high blood pressure, high cholesterol, pre-diabetes and inflammation. To lose the subcutaneous fat that forms not-so-lovable love handles (or excess fat on your hips, thighs and buttocks), it's going to take even more time and effort. What is the best diet for losing your love handles? The one you can stick with long-term, as it's not going to be quick or easy for most people. This is especially true for men, as this is often the last place on their body where they lose weight. In terms of specific exercise recommendations, three top trainers shared the advice they give their A-list clients. Gunnar Peterson, who trains Hollywood actors and professional athletes including the NBA's Los Angeles Lakers, advocates a comprehensive lifestyle approach that includes clean eating, adequate sleep, stress management, plenty of hydration, and sprint work mixed with steady-state cardio on alternate days to optimize fat burning. Sprint work, also known as high-intensity interval training, involves alternating periods of maximum effort with periods of recovery (not be confused with rest). The duration of sprints can increase and recovery periods can decrease as your fitness levels improve. Steady-state cardio involves working out at approximately 65% to 85% of your maximum heart rate for at least 30 minutes. One exercise Peterson does not recommend for reducing love handles is side bends with heavy weights. This type of exercise can actually exacerbate the appearance of love handles by increasing the size of the underlying external oblique muscles. Instead, he recommends working all of the abdominal muscles, not just the obliques, in multiple planes of motion. Exercises that reach those areas include , ,  (at a variety of angles) and banded overhead extensions side to side and back to front.Ami Jampolis, a top San Francisco Bay Area trainer (and, full disclosure, my sister), recommends high-intensity circuit training several times a week to build or maintain calorie-burning muscle, along with several days of steady-state cardiovascular training. High-intensity circuit training involves alternating strength training exercises (such as a pushup) and short bouts of cardiovascular exercises (such as jumping jacks), with minimal rest in between. This type of training is gaining popularity for its fast pace and time efficiency and can be done at home or at a gym that specializes in this type of training. For homing in on the oblique muscles, Jampolis agrees with Peterson about avoiding side bends with weights. Instead, she suggests two very simple yet effective exercises that don't seem to have the bulking effect on the oblique abdominal muscles:  and . Both can be done anywhere and don't require any equipment.Celebrity trainer and nutritionist Harley Pasternak takes an even simpler approach to losing your love handles. In addition to cleaning up their diets, he gives all his clients fitness trackers to ensure that they meet his required 12,000 steps per day and seven hours of sleep per night. He finds that higher-intensity training can often increase appetite, making it harder to stick to a diet, so he prefers simply walking, along with regular strength training that includes working each major body part at least once per week. Although their approaches may vary, professionals agree with the popular saying abs are made in the kitchen, not the gym. If you really want to lose your love handles, start by finding a diet plan that works for you and that you can stick with long-term, and then build in an exercise program that works with your current fitness level, exercise preference, budget and schedule. Lying on your side, lift your body onto your forearm, keeping hips, feet and shoulders stacked over one another. Aim to hold this position for as long as possible, increasing the time as you get stronger. Make sure not to collapse into your upper back. If your balance is a little off, you can place one foot in front of the other for more stability. Switch sides and repeat three times. As you advance, you can drop your hips to the floor and then bring them back up to the side plank position 15 to 20 times and repeat three sets per side.Lie on your back with both knees bent at a 90-degree angle and place your hands behind your head. Fully extend one leg out about 6 inches above the ground, bringing your opposite elbow to the opposite knee. With control, bring the extended leg in and extend the other leg out, simultaneously bringing the other elbow to the opposite knee. Make sure to twist from your stomach and not your neck. Control is key on this exercise; speed is not your friend. Aim for switching every two seconds.

{"title": "Dementia study links your risk with your fitness level", "cate": "health", "content": "Your stamina -- or the time it takes for you to reach peak exhaustion during exercise -- can be tied to your dementia risk, and a new study reveals how.The study, published Wednesday in , found that women with high cardiovascular fitness, or high stamina, had an 88% lower risk of dementia than women who were moderately fit.I was not surprised that there was an association, but I was surprised that it was such a strong association between the group with highest fitness and decreased dementia risk, said Helena H\u00f6rder, a professor in the Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry at the University of Gothenburg in Sweden, who was first author on the study.Dementia is the name for a group of symptoms caused by , often leading to memory loss or other problems with brain function. , an irreversible and progressive brain disease, is the most common type of dementia.About 5.4 million people in the United States are estimated to be , and it is the sixth leading cause of death among all adults, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.About 850,000 people in the United Kingdom have dementia as a whole, according to the UK's .Worldwide, about 50 million people have dementia, and there are nearly 10 million new cases every year, according to the .The new study involved 191 women in Sweden, 38 to 60 years old, who completed an ergometer cycling test to evaluate their cardiovascular fitness.During the test, the women's workload was measured, based on how much weight or resistance could be added to the bicycle before they became fatigued.The level that you are so exhausted that you have to interrupt the test is a measure, in watts, of your work capacity, H\u00f6rder said. Cardiovascular fitness or endurance can also be tested in a submaximal test where you don't push the person to maximal capacity.Some of the women had to interrupt their cycling test at submaximal workload, before being pushed to maximal capacity, mainly due to changes seen on an  or due to high blood pressure.Based on their crude peak workload, the women were separated into three groups: Fifty-nine were in the low fitness group, 92 were medium fitness, and 40 were high fitness.Those cycling tests were conducted in 1968, and the women were followed over a 44-year period until 2012. During that time, the researchers tracked the women's health, taking a close look at who was diagnosed with dementia and who was not.The researchers found that among all of the women, 44 of them (or 23%) developed dementia from 1968 to 2012. Yet among those who interrupted their cycling test at submaximal workload, that percentage jumped to 45%.Many of those who interrupted the test at submax, very low watt level, probably had indications for a poor cardiovascular health status, H\u00f6rder said. This might indicate that processes in the cardiovascular system might be ongoing many decades before onset of dementia diagnosis.The researchers also found that the average age at dementia onset was 11 years older in the high fitness group than in the medium fitness group, and the most pronounced risk reduction was seen among those with the highest fitness: High compared to medium fitness decreased the risk of dementia by 88%, the researchers wrote.The study had some limitations, including that it involved a small sample of women in Sweden. More research is needed to determine whether similar findings would occur in a larger, more diverse group.Also, the findings were not causal. So more research is also needed to determine whether improved fitness could have positive effects on dementia risk and when in life a high fitness level is most important.For instance, other factors could have influenced the findings to help lower dementia risk, regardless of physical activity habits. Genetics or the cognitive stimulation of fitness could have influenced dementia risk, as well as the social aspects of fitness, as .One of the missing pieces of a study like this -- and really the weakness in the literature to date -- is that the kinds of studies that we have mostly seen are association studies. These are studies of correlations, and they can't necessarily talk about causality, said Keith Fargo, director of scientific programs and outreach for the Alzheimer's Association in Chicago, who was not involved in the new study.Still, he said, the picture that is really emerging from the literature is a picture about the importance of fitness in midlife, not just old age, when it comes to protecting your brain health and preventing or delaying Alzheimer's disease and other dementias.The new study adds to that overall growing body of evidence turning a spotlight on dementia and , such as poor cardiovascular health, a sedentary lifestyle, poor diet, smoking or .So people could try to reduce their risk of cognitive decline by engaging in , stopping smoking, eating a healthy diet, getting enough sleep, staying socially engaged, challenging their minds by reading or playing games and of course taking care of their heart health, according to the .There's a very strong connection between cardiovascular health -- so the health of your heart and your circulatory system -- and the health of your brain, Fargo said. The reason for that is because the brain actually is what we would call a highly vascularized organ, meaning that your brain has many blood vessels, he said. The demand for nutrient-, oxygen-rich blood in the brain is very high compared to other organs, and so anything a person can do to increase their cardiovascular fitness level is likely to have positive benefits on brain health."},
{"title": "Understanding emotional intelligence and its effects on your life", "cate": "health", "content": "You might think you're fairly intelligent, but are you emotionally intelligent?It's our emotional intelligence that gives us the ability to read our instinctive feelings and those of others. It also allows us to as well as express and regulate them, according to Yale University's Marc Brackett.Most of us would probably like to think that we can do all of the above. We spot and understand emotions in ourselves and others and label them accurately in order to guide our thoughts and actions.But many of us tend to overestimate our own emotional intelligence, according to Brackett, a professor in the Child Study Center at Yale and founding director of the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence.That's important because experts say the ability to read, understand and respond to emotions in ourselves and other people is a crucial factor in predicting our health,  and personal and professional success.So maybe we all need to take a breath and invest a little more time in schooling ourselves on what it means to be emotionally intelligent.The theory of emotional intelligence -- and the term itself -- originated at Yale and the University of New Hampshire. Peter Salovey, the 23rd president of Yale University, and John Jack Mayer, professor of psychology at the University of New Hampshire, wrote up the theory in 1990, Brackett said.Their work demonstrated how emotions had a marked impact on an individual's thinking and behavior, said Robin Stern, associate director for the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence and an educator, author and licensed psychoanalyst.Experts have continued to build on that framework to refine definitions of what exactly is at the core of of emotional intelligence. Emotional intelligence is being smart about your feelings. It's how to use your emotions to inform your thinking and use your thinking to inform your emotions, she said.It's having an awareness of how your emotions  and behaviors so you can effectively engage with and influence others, said Sara Canaday, a leadership speaker and author. Individuals who are emotionally intelligent tend to be empathetic, can look at situations from an alternative point of view, are considered open-minded, bounce back from challenges and pursue their goals despite any obstacles they might face, according to Canaday.Some people think of emotional intelligence as a soft skill or the ability or the tendency to be nice. It's really about understanding what is going on for you in the moment so that you can make conscious choices about how you want to use your emotions and how you want to manage yourself and how you want to be seen in the world, Stern said. People with more emotional intelligence are healthier, happier and more effective, Brackett said.Canaday further suggests that emotional intelligence is a better predictor of career success than an impressive r\u00e9sum\u00e9 or a high.Wait, really?Well ... just reflect on your own work experiences, Canaday suggests. Has anyone you worked with ever been let go or asked to leave, even when they had the competency or technical skills for the job?  We might be hired for technical talents, but we are often fired because we lack emotional intelligence, Canaday said.Individuals with a low level of emotional intelligence can be successful, she said, but she argues that those individuals could be even more successful if they had a higher level of emotional intelligence. It is how well you can collaborate, how well you engage with others and influence. It's the stories you can tell, the way you can bring data to life in a way that connects with others. Those are the things that are going to set you apart.Behavioral scientists have created a number of emotional intelligence self-assessments, usually broken down into your ability to manage yourself, your ability to manage relationships, your self-awareness and your social awareness, according to Canaday. Your results will be measured along with others who have taken the assessment to give some indication of where you fall on the spectrum from low to high emotional intelligence. But Brackett warns that measurement is a tricky subject. In his early research, he found that people tend to overestimate their emotional intelligence, which is why he believes you must measure it through performance assessments. In a performance assessment, people are required to problem-solve; they must decode facial expressions or strategize in an emotionally tense situation. That way, their knowledge and skills can be tested as opposed to their beliefs about them. Another form of an emotional intelligence test is a 360 assessment. In the workplace setting, a 360 assessment is a process involving feedback from colleagues and supervisors evaluating a person emotional intelligence. Canaday believes that we often see ourselves differently than others do.When a coworker takes the 360 assessment of you it provides an opportunity to compare it to your self-assessment. Another way to take a 360 assessment without undergoing a formal test is to ask a trusted adviser, perhaps a current or former boss, to evaluate your emotional intelligence, she said. But, Canaday cautions, If you ask for someone's feedback, be prepared to accept what they share. This stuff can feel very personal. On one hand, we say we want to learn and grow, but on the other hand, we want to be accepted just the way we are, and those two human traits run counter.So maybe you need to improve your emotional intelligence. How do you do that? From the earliest ages, children should be taught how to recognize their emotions, understand what those emotions mean and label them accurately in order to to , Stern said. For adults who did not receive a solid education on emotional intelligence, improving will require some hard work. Canaday suggests creating an action plan including specific goals. Pick one or two areas where you want to grow, and get some advice on how to best start to embody whatever factor of emotional intelligence you are trying to develop. If you are trying to gain better control of your anger, for example, you might find a healthy outlet for it -- whether it be ,  or . Canaday also suggests seeking out perspectives from those who may not agree with you. Be intentional about that. Take active steps to do that. If you constantly surround yourself with people who believe just like you do, then you are hearing the same conversations, and you are not growing, and you are not learning to be open to perspectives.Brackett advises seeking out strategies that are effective for managing emotions. Practice them and then evaluate how those strategies are working for you. It's important to spend time reflecting on and thinking about your influence and how people respond to your emotions, be more self- and socially aware about your presence. Stern suggests prolonging the time between when you are triggered by something and when you respond. Pause, slow down and take a deep breath. Imagine what your best self looks like. Taking the time to pause and think about what your best self would do in each situation may help you avoid letting your emotions control you. You are allowing yourself time to manage your emotions.  can also have a huge impact on our emotions and our health if that , Stern says. She suggests that we would never talk to another individual the way we often talk to ourselves. There is no question in my mind that if people were to really appreciate how important emotions are, allowed themselves to have emotions, made space for other people to have their emotions and handled those emotions skillfully in the service of making a better world, we would in fact have a better world.

{"title": "How to break carb cravings, once and for all ", "cate": "health", "content": "If you're like many people I know, the thought of giving up pasta and bread in an effort to shed a few pounds (or more) might seem like an unfair punishment -- perhaps even a tease, especially when those foods seem to be on everyone else's plates.The truth is, despite the popularity of low-carb diets, which often send the message that we should drastically cut back on this food group, carbohydrates are some of the most important things we consume. They are key to regulating blood sugar and providing energy throughout our bodies. Without them, our bodies will rely on protein, breaking it down for energy instead of using it in its preferred role of growing and maintaining tissues. What's more, eating the right kinds of carbs can keep us healthier.The people who live the longest, healthiest lives -- who have the lowest rates of diabetes, heart disease and cancer -- their diets are all rich in healthy carbs, including beans, legumes, whole grains and fruit, said Tamara Duker Freuman, a New York City-based registered dietitian.And so there's nothing wrong with a pasta meal (though whole grain is preferred) or even a sandwich on whole-wheat bread for lunch every day. Simply, the problem is not that we consume carbs; it's that we often consume the wrong kinds of carbs -- and very large portions of them. Highly processed carbs -- white bread, sugary cereal, white rice, regular pasta and bagels, for example  --  produce rapid rises and drops in blood sugar, which can lead to weight gain. They also can lead to something called metabolic syndrome, which is associated with an increased risk for heart disease, stroke and diabetes.Metabolic syndrome is the combination of high triglycerides and low HDL cholesterol, insulin resistance and obesity, explained Dr. David Ludwig, professor of nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. And processed carbs are the main dietary drivers. Studies show that processed carbs top the list for weight gain and diabetes risk, he said. The tricky part is that the more processed, refined carbs we eat, the more we crave. And so it seems almost impossible to get off the carb-craving hamster wheel. According to Ludwig, who wrote the book Always Hungry? Conquer Cravings, Retrain Your Fat Cells, and Lose Weight Permanently, cravings have to do with our consumption of these highly processed, fast-acting carbs, which he says are not fundamentally different from sugar, in the biological sense. White bread or any other processed carbohydrate will melt into glucose very quickly -- and so like sugar, it raises blood sugar at a faster rate than slower-digesting carbs that are less processed and higher in fiber. The problem is, that rapid spike in blood sugar is eventually followed by a crash.According to Ludwig, what drives most carb cravings is not the taste of the foods per se  but rather a biological urge to eat something to restore your blood sugar. And it has to do with the hormone insulin. Processed carbs cause more insulin secretion, calorie for calorie, than any food, he said. When you eat processed carbs, blood sugar rises rapidly, and insulin quickly follows, directing incoming calories into\u00a0liver, muscle and fat cells. But of these, only fat cells have virtually limitless ability to store calories, and too many get trapped there, according to Ludwig. A short while later, the calories in the bloodstream are low, and the body runs out of available fuel, making you hungry too soon after the meal. In essence, when fat cells get too much energy, there's not enough to fuel the brain, which is constantly monitoring the calories in your blood. When (the brain) sees calories are dropping, it triggers hunger and cravings, Ludwig said. And it all relates back to that initial insulin response. Insulin is the Miracle-Gro for fat cells, he said. When fat cells grow, we get hungry. And so the cycle repeats, eventually causing weight gain.Nutrition experts say that breaking carb cravings is not about getting rid of carbs entirely but rather cutting back on highly processed fast-acting carbs and eating more high-quality ones that are high in fiber and low in added sugars, such as beans, whole grains, fruit and vegetables. If you don't know how to get started, this plan can help:1. Cut out all starchy carbs for one week. This includes all pasta, bread, rice, bagels and potatoes, as well as pizza, crackers, pretzels, chips, cookies and cake. By cutting starchy carbs and replacing them with foods that have a more modest impact on blood sugar, you can achieve more steady blood sugar control and better manage your cravings, according to Freuman. A day might include egg whites and cheese with berries for breakfast, yogurt for a snack, a grilled chicken salad with beans for lunch, an apple for a snack and a piece of fish and veggies for dinner. 2. Slash the sugary carbs too, including candy and sugar-sweetened beverages. These sugary carbs rapidly flood the bloodstream, providing lots of sugar without any added nutrition. 3. Add some fat. Many high-fat foods are luscious and do not cause an insulin release, so they keep your blood sugar much more stable, Ludwig said. Examples include nuts, nut butters, avocado, olive oil, dark chocolate and full-fat dairy. When you are eating them, you don't miss the processed carbs at all!4. After the first week, you can gradually add back high-quality starchy carbs, starting with breakfast.Research in a variety of populations has shown that eating carbs at breakfast seems to dampen the blood sugar effect of eating carbs at lunch, Freuman said. What this means is that on a day that you skip breakfast, you may be more likely to have a blood sugar spike after eating a carb-rich lunch, compared with a day when you eat breakfast but have the same lunch. In other words, don't skip breakfast, and don't skip carbs at breakfast, Freuman said. High-quality carbs -- including minimally processed grains, along with non-starchy vegetables, whole fruits and beans -- are the ones to choose. They are delicious and slower-digesting, thanks to the way they are naturally packaged, Ludwig said. If you eat wheat berries, your body has to digest the intact grain kernel, and that's a slow process. But if you mill it and turn it into flour, now that whole package has been broken. Too much of these 'naked carbs' (stripped of their bran and germ, which contain nutrients) will cause metabolic problems for most people.\u00a0Breakfast examples with high-quality carbs include steel-cut oats with nuts, seeds and cinnamon; rye crisp bread with scrambled eggs and berries; or Greek yogurt topped with fruit. Freuman recommends beans at breakfast too, as in a Mexican breakfast with eggs, beans, avocado and salsa. 5. After the second week, you can add back high-quality starchy carbs (i.e. minimally processed grains) to lunch. Good lunch examples include a chickpea or quinoa salad, bean or lentil soups, mushroom barley soup or a sandwich with whole-grain bread. Whole-wheat pasta or chickpea pasta is a good choice too, according to Freuman, though it should take up only about a quarter of the plate, to allow room for veggies and protein.6. Continue to skip starchy carbs at dinner. At dinner, when we eat carbs, we are much more likely to have a blood sugar spike and to store that food energy as fat versus having it available for useable energy, Freuman said. The metabolic response to a carbier meal at night is less favorable than when we eat carbs earlier in the day, so if there is ever one meal that you want eat low-carb, it's dinner ... and if you want to include them, choose wisely and keep the portions low, she added.7. Continue to limit refined carbs, such as white bread and white rice. It might be difficult to forgo white basmati rice, pizza or sushi entirely, but limit these foods to a few times per week.8. Continue to avoid foods high in added sugars. If you have a sweet tooth, limit treats to 100 to 150 calories per day, depending on your goals.And note that anyone with a medical issue should always consult their doctor before starting a new diet plan.

{"title": "The science of a happy marriage", "cate": "health", "content": "Have you ever waited with excitement to share some amazingly good news with your partner, only to experience a surge of frustration and resentment when he or she barely reacts to your announcement? As a society, we place a huge amount of emphasis on being there for each other when we're in need, but  has actually shown that relationship satisfaction is influenced as much, if not more, by how we react to each other's good news. Whereas emotional support from a partner when we're down can have  of making us feel indebted and more aware of our negative emotions, a partner's positive reaction to our good news can  of that good fortune and  to them.Now , published in Human Brain Mapping, has added to this picture, showing that the relationship satisfaction of longtime married elderly women is particularly related to the neural activity they show in response to their husbands' displays of positive emotion, rather than negative emotion.Psychologist Raluca Petrican at the Rotman Research Institute in Toronto and her colleagues at the University of Toronto recruited 14 women with an average age of 72 who'd been married for an average of 40 years. The researchers scanned these women's brains as they watched some carefully prepared videos.The silent 10-second videos showed each woman's husband or a stranger displaying an emotion that mismatched the way the video clip was labeled in a one-sentence description on the screen. For example, the clip might show the husband smiling or laughing about a happy memory (such as the first house they bought), but the video was labeled misleadingly to suggest that the man was showing this emotion while talking about a sad memory (such as the time he got fired). Other videos showed the reverse mismatch: a negative emotional display, ostensibly shown while talking about the memory of a happy event.Essentially, the videos were designed to make the women feel like they were seeing their husband or the stranger display a surprising emotional reaction that didn't match their own feelings. The real-world equivalent would be a situation in which a husband is happy about something that his wife doesn't get; and the questions are whether she will notice, and whether she is she more sensitive to this incongruent emotion in her husband than she would be in a stranger.The first important finding to emerge from this setup was that the women showed enhanced overall brain activity -- which suggests more mental and emotional neural processing  -- when watching the videos of their husbands compared with videos of the strangers, but only when the videos showed displays of surprisingly incongruent positive emotion. During the other types of videos (when the men appeared to display strangely negative emotion), the women's brains showed just as much overall activity when watching a stranger as when watching their husband. In other words, their levels of whole-brain activity betrayed a special sensitivity to their husband's (versus a stranger's) unexpected positive emotion.    This jibes with the  that's shown it's our response to our partners' positive news that is all-important for relationship satisfaction. Remember that these women had been married for decades, so it's likely that they and their husbands have been doing something right relationship-wise. The brain-imaging data suggest part of the reason might be that the women are acutely tuned to when their husbands are showing happiness that's personal to them (rather than common to both partners).This specific interpretation trips up a little with another main result: The women's levels of marital satisfaction (according to a questionnaire) correlated with the amount of neural processing they showed in response to their husbands positive and negative emotion.However, the special importance of how we respond to our partners' positive emotion was supported by another key finding. Namely, women who scored higher on relationship satisfaction showed more brain activation in regions thought to contain mirror neurons (neurons that are considered important for empathy) when watching their spouses than they did when watching a stranger. Moreover, this enhanced mirror-neuron activity was especially present for the videos showing their husbands' positive, rather than negative, emotion. Again, this appears to support the idea that marital happiness goes hand in hand with sensitivity to our partners' positive emotion (though the researchers acknowledge a different or complementary interpretation that people in happy relationships have a suppressed response to their partners' incongruent negative emotion).We need to interpret these preliminary and complex findings with caution. And the exclusive focus on wives' reactions to their husbands' emotions does lend the study a slightly retro '70s vibe -- what about the way that husbands respond to their wives' emotions, and the importance of that for the marital happiness of both parties? But that said, the results are tantalizing in suggesting that at a neural level, people in a long-term, committed relationship are especially sensitive to their partners' positive emotion, and particularly so when this emotion is different from their own. This neatly complements other past research showing, for example, that people who are unable to differentiate their partners' emotions from their own (they assume they're the same), tend to be viewed by their partners as more controlling and smothering.As a whole, this entire body of research gives pause for thought. How do you react when your partner arrives home on an emotional high? Would you only notice if you were feeling happy too?"},
{"title": "6 common mistakes new runners make", "cate": "health", "content": "Running is a great way to get in shape and just about everyone can do it. You don't need access to a fancy gym, expensive equipment, or other people to do the workout. You can simply throw on your sneakers and head out the door for a run. Easy as that!Given that it's so easy to take up the sport, a lot of beginners jump right into running without actually knowing what it takes to establish a healthy routine. Many make a number of common mistakes, which can interfere with training or lead to injury. If you're just starting out, keep these things in mind to help you increase your chances of running success.One of the biggest mistakes newbie runners make is doing too much too soon. Picking up a new hobby like running is no doubt exciting, but novice runners need to ease into the sport by building up a mileage base before increasing the distance, intensity, and frequency of their runs. Slowly easing into a training program will help reduce the risk of injury, so you can continue on with your new running routine. Many experts suggest increasing your mileage by no more than 10% each week. Beginners might think they need to run every day (or nearly every day) to meet their fitness or weight-loss goals, but this couldn't be further from the truth. Running is a high-impact activity which can be really hard on your body, especially for novice runners whose muscles and bones haven't yet been conditioned for such intense exercise. So it's important to give your body ample rest between workouts. Follow a training plan that includes rest days.While it may be true that you don't need expensive equipment to take up running, it's important that you wear proper gear for your workouts. The most important piece of equipment for running is a good pair of running shoes, so be sure to do some research before you purchase a pair. Visit a running specialty store and ask an employee to fit you for a shoe. They will analyze your gait and then recommend a few options in your budget. Also essential: A supportive sports bra.When newbies take up running, they typically dive head first into their training with run after run. Running definitely makes you a better runner, but not if your regular exercise routine lacks variety in the form of cross-training. It's important to mix up your workouts so you're not always using the same muscles, which can put you at risk for overuse injuries and ultimately derail your efforts.Running can be uncomfortable at times, especially for new runners. That feeling is all part of becoming a better runner, but pain is a different story altogether. If something hurts when you run, you need to stop and treat the pain. Remember: It doesn't make you less of a runner if you listen to your body to keep it healthy. Don't run through pain unless you want to end up on the sidelines.When you're just starting out with running, it's tough not to compare yourself to others. You're excited about running, so you're probably reading running blogs, magazines, and message boards where you might start to feel inadequate about your own mileage or running pace. Instead of getting down on yourself, remember that every runner was once a beginner and use their success as motivation!. "},
{"title": "The annual running of the ... burros?", "cate": "health", "content": "Consider the glorious but humble donkey. According to the Bible, Jesus rode one, not a horse, into Jerusalem. The significance was that it was a common man's animal for the common man's king, rather than a more traditionally royal steed. And its Sunday school lore that his mother rode one from Nazareth while pregnant, though that's not in the official canon. I checked.Domesticated for about 5,000 years, donkeys have been put to work for humanity's historically changing needs. They've been the family car, our U-Haul vans, engines pulling barges in canals and wagons out West, and they've been our workmates -- if you work in a mine or on a farm. They're still used in military operations to carry ground air missiles over difficult terrain.Burros, as the Spanish call them, walk at about a human's foot speed. They rarely kick or bite. They seem to have a calming effect on horses and humans. And they don't get nearly the respect they deserve, the Rodney Dangerfields of the animal kingdom.Like a cross between a Tesla and a wheelbarrow, donkeys are beasts of burden that can carry up to 300 pounds for more than two weeks in the mountains, while needing very little food or water. They're sort of the camels of the West. In fact, they're the camels of the East, North and South, too, as donkeys continue to thrive in North and South America, Europe, Asia and Africa. As some industries faded, the donkey soon added racing partner to its resume. When the US mining industry started to dry up in the 1930s and '40s, some enterprising Coloradans came up with the idea of attracting spectators to their towns by hosting an ultramarathon of human-donkey pairs -- The World Championship Pack Burro Race. They teach us so much, said pack burro race director Brad Wann. They teach us humility. They connect us with nature. Burros have the ability to reach into your soul.The first race was in 1949, which makes it, according Wann, the second-oldest continuously run marathon in the country after the Boston Marathon. The race also lends itself to a variety of puns. For example, the winner of the annual pack burro championship is the first to get his or her ass over the finish line. Wann's title is media relations officer for the . There are eight of these eye-rollers in this article if you'd like to spot them all.But it's still a serious sport, even if it has a sense of humor.  is the title of a very straight documentary about the sport.Originally the race extended between Leadville and Fairplay, located in the middle of the state and only about 11 miles apart as the crow flies, but separated by a mountain. Legend holds that it was inspired by two miners who struck gold simultaneously and raced back to town to claim the find. The real story is that the race was inspired by a desire to keep former mining towns from turning into ghosts.Now both towns have their own races, part of an annual series of eight in Colorado. Fairplay, is the longest (29 miles), tied for highest (more than 13,000 feet), and the one that retained the World Championship title. The town is also home to the Prunes Monument, possibly the only monument in the world erected to honor a donkey. Prunes worked alongside a miner for more than 60 years.Race day, in July, was a cool one of blue skies. This year 89 -- a record number -- of human-burro pairs competed in the 70th world championship, assembling in the Old West-looking Fairplay. Wann estimates at least 150,000 people showed up to watch the start of the race. The smell of excitement and excrement was in the air as the starter gun signaled a mass start of two lengths. The 29-mile race had 20 pairs and 3,300 feet of elevation gain and a short course of 15 miles had another 69 pairs.The start of the race is critical, explained Wann. Don't break their will, let the burro set the pace early on instead of shutting it down, he explained. Burros will pair up and want to go that pace, and you have to feel that out. So run as fast you can -- sprint if the donkey does. If you can't do that you'll have a slow donkey the rest of the race. It's a burro race, not a human race.The course also ends in Fairplay, running through South Park (the show of the same name has somehow not done a burro racing episode), and then heading up dirt roads, trails and rocky terrain to the 13,185-foot summit of Mosquito Pass. (Or should that be Mosquito P-ass?) The age range of the human runners at this year's world championship was 15 to 70, and they came from all over the US, Europe, Canada and even Africa. The California team brought in their own donkeys. About 65% were repeat runners addicted to the niche sport which consistently only takes place in Colorado, the state where it was born. About a third of the runners were women this year. In fact, the first woman to ever compete was Edna Miller, with her burro Pill, in 1951, nearly 20 years before the first woman ran the Boston Marathon (against the rules, even then). The donks -- as insiders may refer to them -- that competed this year have adorable and delicious names such as Buckwheat, Hershey and Sweet Pea. Past winners have included BonBon and Cream Puff. My favorite name for a competitor this year was ReDONKulous. This year included 16 mini-donkeys on the short course. And don't call donkeys mules, which are actually half donkey and half horse breeds. Those half-assed animals aren't allowed to race in the pack burro circuit.Rules state that the donks (I'm an insider now) must carry mining equipment: a pick, gold pan, shovel and saddle. This weighs about 16 pounds and for the mini-donkeys that's all they need; standard-sized donkeys must add weights to a minimum of 33 pounds. The rope attaching the team can't be longer than 15 feet and the runners don't dress as miners, though the occasional cowboy hat may allude to an earlier era.Like any ultramarathon, especially with elevation, endurance requires training. And in this case some animal husbandry skills as well. As a result, there are, of course, comical moments for bystanders watching when the donkey protests. Sometimes a burro will just shut down. In previous races, teams have had to drop out when this happens. The air may be thin on oxygen up on Mosquito Pass, but the mountain views are amazing. Green and grey peaks are in all directions, the viewsas wild and West as some of pack animals.This year's winning team was Kirt Courkamp and his burro Mary Margaret, finishing the 29 miles in just over 6 hours and winning the $1,000 first place prize. These two locals won the last two years and this year won in Leadville and Buena Vista too, collectively known as the Triple Crown. In the whole world, there are probably fewer than 1,000 people who have ever competed in a pack-burro race, the late Denver Post columnist Ed Quillen , arguing for it to be the state's official sport. (In 2012, pack burro racing was designated a summer heritage sport of Colorado.)If you want to be among this elite crew, your training is two-fold. You need to condition yourself to run long distances \u2014 putting in the hours on trail runs and at high altitudes -- as the pack burro race is a very challenging course.Then there is driving a donkey. They don't need to acclimate to the altitude or learn how to properly fuel themselves with calories and hydration to go the distance. But runners still benefit with getting as many miles together as possible. There are techniques and personality differences among the animals that need to be m-ass-tered to have a successful run. If the burro doesn't trust you, or like you, or you are pushing too hard, said Wann, it's not going to work. Organizers don't recommend it but you can show up the day before a burro pack race and rent a donkey. Amber Wann, a self described donkey matchmaker and wife of Brad, rents them for races and tries to match running speed and equine experience.Burro racing is a very mental game, he added. We're navigating through some of the roughest terrain in the world and you have to build a relationship with your ass to make that happen.Running with a donkey is a bit of give and take, literally. Sometimes you're pulling them, other times they're pulling you. Uphill they can be a real ass-et if they are in the lead and pulling a bit. But going downhill, runners want to be in the lead lest they find themselves getting dragged by a fast and enthusiastic 900-pound burro which can haul ass at speeds up to 40 miles per hour. On flats, either teammate can be in the lead, or side-by-side, but human runners are still doing the steering. You control a donkey through their nose, pulling back on the rope to slow down, like a gas pedal of pressure-and-release to change speed. A whistle or a hup-hup! can get 'em goin' and the classic whoa can slow 'em down. The donkey of course doesn't know where it's going. Humans are the GPS for the critters, Wann said. Gear-wise, runners need the right shoes, clothes, running vests and fuel for an ultramarathon. And the burros, in addition to getting a clean bill of health from a vet, need the old timey mining equipment and added weight to carry.As with any ultramarathon trail run, injuries are always possible. According to a 2015 study involving 1,212 active ultrarunners, they suffered about , though some wounds were inflicted by the obstacles of trail running. The most common injuries were of the knee and foot stress fractures.Being tethered to a donkey adds risk of injury to runners, of course. If you trip, you can get serious road rash from getting dragged along. One year a runner bruised or broke some ribs when her burro kicked her in the chest. The rules don't allow runners to ride the donkey, but in the race's history, injured runners have been carried down the mountain on their partners' back, as they're out of the race anyway. Donkeys get injured too, but in 70 years of racing, not one animal has died or been injured beyond recovery. Animal rights groups have raised eyebrows about the sport but organizers stress the humane treatment of the burros. Any contestant mistreating his animal may be disqualified, the race rules state. No needles, electric prods, narcotics, clubs or whips, other than the halter rope, may be used. But the runners' love for their donkey partners makes this rule seemingly superfluous. Organizers also point out that donkeys enjoy the race as much as the ultra-runners. If you observe donkeys in the wild, they aren't sedentary creatures, wrote Western Pack Burro Ass-ociation member Sheri L. Thompson on the sport's race website. In the wild, donkeys are very trim athletic animals and they exercise all day long. They are willing participants, Thompson writes, alluding to the burro's famous stubbornness. If they don't want to go, you can't make them do anything."},
{"title": "Is cheese healthy?", "cate": "health", "content": "Yes, cheese is nutrient-rich -- and tasty -- but it's best to consume it in small portions. \u00a0Cheese does contain some important nutrients, including calcium and protein, along with vitamin B12 and zinc. However, the calories can add up quickly if you aren't mindful, said Kelly Pritchett, a registered dietitian and spokeswoman for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.\u00a0  Softer cheeses tend to have fewer calories than hard cheeses: an ounce of whole-milk ricotta (approximately 2 tablespoons) has about 50 calories, an ounce of feta has 75 calories, and an ounce of whole-milk mozzarella has 85 calories. But an ounce of Swiss (one slice) has 108 calories, and an ounce of cheddar has 114 calories (picture about a one-inch cube, depending on the kind).  For the same calories, you can have a cup of black bean soup and probably feel just as full.Cheese is also high in saturated fat, which is known to increase LDL cholesterol, the bad cholesterol. In fact, cheese is one of the biggest sources of  in .  (supported by the Danish dairy board) suggests that full-fat cheeses don't seem to negatively affect LDL cholesterol as would be predicted based on its saturated fat content.  It is not clear exactly why this is the case but may have to do with other nutrients in cheese, like calcium or protein, modifying the way the fat is absorbed or metabolized, said Gregory D. Miller, chief science officer for the National Dairy Council.  Still, when it comes to fat content, some cheeses are lighter than others -- and the higher the fat, the higher the calories. Cottage cheese has the least amount of fat, with 1 gram per ounce. Ricotta has 4 grams of fat per ounce, and feta and mozzarella have 6 grams each. Parmesan, Swiss and cheddar are higher in fat, with 7, 8 and 9 grams of fat per ounce, respectively.   Using soft cheeses like mozzarella\u00a0versus cheddar can be helpful if you are looking for ways to cut calories, Pritchett said.Interestingly, despite its higher calorie content, hard cheese like cheddar can be beneficial for your teeth. Aside from getting calcium and other minerals from it, , which helps make your mouth less acidic and your teeth less prone to cavities. Pritchett suggests using cheese as a flavor enhancer for\u00a0meals instead of making it the focus: sprinkle\u00a0feta or goat cheese on a salad for extra flavor, or add Parmesan to your favorite soup for extra pep. And if you are enjoying cheese with crackers, limit it to 1 ounce.  This would be the equivalent of a couple of dominos for softer cheeses like Brie, goat cheese or Havarti and about 4 small dice for hard cheese like Swiss or cheddar. Limiting portions will also keep sodium levels in check, as it can be as high as 260 milligrams for an ounce of feta and 390 milligrams for an ounce of hard Parmesan.So feel free to enjoy cheese, but just be careful not to overdo it.Lisa Drayer is a nutritionist, an author and a CNN health and nutrition contributor.

{"title": "10 best foods for your heart", "cate": "health", "content": "Keeping your heart healthy is about more than avoiding fast food and overly processed chow. You can also pump up your heart's health by choosing foods that will help reduce cholesterol, lower blood pressure and reduce inflammation. Which food groups have the most science behind their heart-healthy claims? The cell walls of oats and barley contain a special type of soluble fiber called beta-glucan, which has a host of benefits for human health.it blunts the body's insulin response and boosts immunity, and it may be protective during radiation and chemotherapy. But its role in cholesterol reduction is what counts for heart health.Beta-glucans bind to bile acids and cholesterol in the intestines and prevent their absorption into the body, CNN contributor and registered dietitian  said. So, if you have high cholesterol, it would be a good idea to incorporate oats or oatmeal for breakfast on a regular basis. Other grains, such as rye, wheat and sorghum, contain beta-glucans but in much smaller quantities than oats and barley. in seaweed, baker's yeast and various species of mushrooms such as reishi, shiitake and maitake.Research shows that eating 3 grams of beta-glucans a day will reduce cholesterol by up to 10%. , a British charity dedicated to helping those with high cholesterol, you can accomplish by eating a bowl of oatmeal each day; adding 2 tablespoons of oat bran to your smoothie, soup or entree at lunch; and having an oatmeal cookie for a snack.Heart UK says you can replace one of those oat servings with 150 grams (\u2154 cup) of cooked pearl barley.Fish oils, especially omega-3 fatty acids, are critical for maintaining a healthy heart. That means fatty fish such as salmon, albacore tuna, mackerel, herring, lake trout and sardines and crustaceans such as lobster, oysters and squid are the protein staples of a heart-healthy diet. They all contain health-protective omega-3s, specifically the long-chain variety known as LC omega-3, which contain eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosapentaenoic acid (DPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Long-chain omega-3s have been shown in human clinical trials to prevent heart attacks by helping the heart maintain its rhythm.  show that they also make blood less likely to clot, lower blood pressure, keep blood vessels healthy and less likely to narrow, reduce triglycerides and lower inflammation. Whew!The shorter chain of omega-3, called alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), is found abundantly in oils, plants, nuts and seeds, but evidence of its benefit is not as strong.The plant-based omega-3s in foods like flaxseed, walnuts and canola oil don't contain DHA and EPA, Drayer said. And while there are benefits to the plant ones as well, you can't count on them as a source for their longer-chain cousins, because they are not necessarily converted into them once they are in the body.Fatty fish like  have the most long-chain omega-3s, and the American Heart Associationadding a 3\u00bd-ounce serving to your diet at least twice a week. Children and pregnant women should be careful to consume fish with lower levels of mercury, the association says, such as fresh and water-packed canned salmon.However, Drayer says, be careful how you prepare your catch.You can make healthy foods unhealthy depending on how you cook them, Drayer said. For example, if you deep-fry fish, all the unhealthy saturated or trans fat can outweigh the heart-healthy benefits. Ideally, you want to broil, bake, grill or poach -- but in water, not in oil.  Oil will contribute lots of extra calories.  If a menu doesn't specify, ask how the fish is poached.What if fatty fish is just not your thing?If you never eat fish, you might consider a fish-oil supplement because of all the research on omega-3's benefits for heart and brain health, Drayer said. There are some foods fortified with EPA and DHA omega-3s, added registered dietitian  a spokeswoman for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. Some of them are eggs, milk, juices, peanut butter and margarine spreads.So instead of having regular spread on your toast, you can add something to your diet that has an added heart benefit, Drayer said. Why not give yourself an added edge?Be aware that most fortified foods have a  of the omega-3s of fatty fish and may be the shorter-chain variety.Salad greens, spinach, kale, swiss chard, collard and mustard greens are  in vitamins A, C, E and K and contain antioxidants that help rid toxins from the body. But it's their  of calcium, magnesium and potassium that puts them on the top 10 list for heart health.Potassium, magnesium and calcium are known to play a role in blood pressure regulation, said Al Bochi, who specializes in helping patients with Type 2 diabetes who are at high risk for heart disease.Potassium is known to help with limiting the effects of sodium on blood pressure, she explained, And it, along with magnesium and calcium, help the walls of the blood vessels relax, which increases blood flow and reduces blood pressure.Greens have minimal calories: One cup of spinach or Swiss chard is only 7 calories, and kale has 33. Nutritionists say it's usually best to get your calcium, magnesium and potassium from foods instead of supplements, so pile that plate high.  Plus, greens -- like most vegetables -- are full of fiber, which helps lower cholesterol levels, prevents constipation (and therefore hemorrhoids) and, by helping you feel full, helps with weight control. And of course, maintaining a healthy weight is a key to good heart health. Unsalted seeds and nuts are also high in potassium, magnesium and other minerals known to reduce blood pressure. on , for example, find that the nut can reduce blood vessel tightening (called peripheral vascular resistance), heart rate, blood pressure and cholesterol. According to, a single helping a day was better at lowering blood pressure than two helpings.Walnuts, pecans, almonds, flaxseed, macadamia nuts and hazelnuts are also good choices. Walnuts are especially high in omega-3s but are the short-chain variety. Still, that's good for the heart.Though to a lesser extent than long-chain omega-3s, Drayer said, alpha linolenic acid (ALA) -- a short-chain omega-3 found in walnuts and flaxseed and canola oil -- has been associated with protection against high blood pressure and heart disease.  But keep in mind that all nuts are extremely high in calories. So an American Heart Association  is going to seem tiny: about 1\u00bd ounces or 2 tablespoons of nut butter. Beware of the added salt, sugar or chocolate that is so appealing on nuts -- not good for heart health.A surprising choice? Beets turn out to be chock full of nitric oxide, which  show can help open blood vessels and therefore lower your blood pressure. In fact, a  of Australian men and women found that drinking 500 grams (about 2\u00bd cups) of beet juice significantly lowered systolic blood pressure (the top number in a blood pressure reading) within six hours. That's not all. Beets and their juice are one of the only sources of betalain, a powerful antioxidant with high anti-inflammatory qualities, which has sparked research into how beets could be used to treat diseases caused by chronic inflammation, such as, and Already eating a healthy diet? Be sure to add avocadoes once a day. A  published in the Journal of the American Heart Association found that replacing saturated fat with one nutrient-packed avocado a day could lead to up to a 13.5 milligrams-per-deciliter reduction in blood pressure. That could be enough to keep some people off blood pressure meds, researchers say.Avocados are a rich source of monounsaturated fatty acids, which can  both your total cholesterol and your bad cholesterol (LDL) while maintaining your good cholesterol (HDL) levels. They can also benefit l, which can be very helpful to those with prediabetes or Type 2 diabetes.Monounsaturated fatty acids are a mainstay of the Mediterranean diet, which has been shown to improve and , lower risk for  and increase .A key component of the Mediterranean diet is the use of olive oil for cooking and for dressing salads and vegetables in place of more saturated fats, such as butter. Olive oil is rich in monounsaturated fatty acids and has been shown to reduce blood pressure and both bad cholesterol and triglycerides while increasing good cholesterol.  HDL is often called the friendly scavenger because it scours the blood for bad cholesterol and gets rid of it before it clogs arteries. That's why having high levels of HDL is considered good for the heart.A  of 300 Spanish men and women at high risk for cardiovascular events sheds some light on how the higher HDL from olive oil might work. Researchers compared people who ate a Mediterranean diet based on nuts and a group based on olive oil. The group who ate more olive oil had better-functioning HDL; in other words, their HDL was more efficient at finding and removing LDL and sending it to the liver as waste.  Regardless of how it works, olive oil is extremely high in calories. It should be used in moderation and as a replacement for more unhealthy fats in the diet.No heart-healthy list would be complete without legumes, which include all kinds of beans, lentils, chickpeas and black-eyed peas. Legumes  because of their high levels of soluble fiber, which is known to lower both cholesterol and triglyceride levels in the bloodstream. Soluble fiber binds to extra LDL cholesterol in the body and disposes it in the form of waste, Al Bochi said. You can think of it as a type of sponge.Studies have shown that eating less than a cup of legumes improved , and a found that obese subjects who ate two servings a day of legumes and four servings of whole grains reduced their waist circumference, weight, triglycerides and blood pressure.Legumes contain no cholesterol and are only about 3% fat (unless they are prepared with lard or other unhealthy fats). They are full of iron, manganese, copper, B vitamins, magnesium, zinc and phosphorous, and they are very low on the glycemic index, which means they have less effect on your blood sugar. They are also extremely high in protein; for example, a half-cup of some legumes has 8 grams of protein.One caveat: Most people eat canned version of beans and other legumes, which will be packed with salt as a preservative. Salt, of course, can raise blood pressure.Make sure that you rinse the excess salt and water before consuming, Al Bochi said.  And it's not just beans and lentils. Whether it's canned corn, canned peas, carrots, any type of canned food, it's important to remove the salt.It may seem odd to include dairy in a list of top heart-healthy foods, but it turns out that milk, cheese and yogurt can help reduce blood pressure. In a by Boston University, researchers followed the eating habits of 75,000 people for up to 30 years and found that women who ate yogurt at least five times a week had a 20% reduction in their risk of developing high blood pressure. Milk and cheese also had an impact on lowering blood pressure, but it was nothing like yogurt, said the researchers. Men in the study consumed much less yogurt than the women; the effect on their blood pressure was weaker.Dairy products contain calcium, potassium and magnesium, which are important minerals to help with blood pressure control, Al Bochi said.  Those in the study who benefited most also closely followed the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute's, which stands for Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension. Its premise is simple: Eat more veggies, fruits and low-fat dairy foods while cutting way back on any food high in saturated fat, and limit your intake of salt.The DASH meal plan includes three whole-grain products each day, four to six servings of vegetables, four to six servings of fruit, two to four servings of dairy products and several servings each of lean meats and nuts/seeds/legumes.You're getting the combination of benefits by consuming these foods because they do offer more than one heart-healthy nutrient, Drayer said.In the Boston study, men and women who had a higher DASH score and who ate yogurt five or more times each week were 31% less likely to develop hypertension than participants who had low DASH scores and ate little yogurt.Though the study didn't track the type of yogurt eaten, experts stress choosing low-fat versions.Dairy products can contain a high amount of saturated fat, so be sure to choose low-fat products, Al Bochi said. Saturated fat has been known to increase LDL cholesterol, the bad cholesterol that can cause heart disease.No. 10 on the heart healthy list may seem odd, but it's important. Experts say that rather than focusing on just one or two of the heart healthy foods, you would be better served to eat a well-rounded diet that focuses on healthy foods of all types and colors.If you feel like there is a 'superfood' that you want to incorporate on a daily basis, say oats or salmon, that's OK, Drayer said, but I really feel that eating a variety of healthy foods is best, because you're getting a different nutrient package with each.The other thing I worry about is when people focus on one food, they may think that is their key to good health and eat more unhealthy foods, Drayer added. For example, some people say, 'I eat a lot of kale, so I'm healthy,' and they don't pay attention to the rest of their diet. No one food can undo damage from an unhealthy diet.Unless your doctor says otherwise, part of a heart-healthy diet is watching your salt intake. The hidden salt in many of our processed foods make it extremely difficult: It's estimated that Americans get up to 80% of the salt in their diet from processed foods. The American Heart Association has a list of some of the top offenders, called the Salty Six: breads and rolls, cold cuts and cured meats, sandwiches, pizza, soup and chicken.Some ways to help reduce the amount of sodium in yourdiet is to limit the amount of processed foods, the amount of frozen dinners, for example, as well as adding salt to foods yourself, Al Bochi said. Consider using some herbs and spices as well as fresh lemon and vinegar to add some flavor to your meals.Finally, a heart-healthy diet should just be part of an overall heart-healthy plan that includes exercise, weight loss, stress reduction and not smoking.Correction: A previous version of this story misstated where beta-glucans are absorbed in the body."},
{"title": "Fighting salt and sugar cravings, with spicy food", "cate": "health", "content": "There's no magic pill that will cure you of your cravings. But there is something that may help the effort, and it's all-natural.Research has shown that simply spicing up your diet may help you consume less salt and possibly less sugar, while potentially improving your health even beyond the reduction of salt and sugar. There is more consistent evidence that spicy food helps curb salt cravings than sugar. In  involving more than 600 people from China whose brains were analyzed with PET/CT scans, researchers found that regions stimulated by intake of both salty and spicy foods overlapped. Because of similar activities taking place in this shared space (think of the overlapping parts of a Venn diagram), consuming spicy foods effectively enhanced one's sensitivity to salt, thereby helping people crave and consume less salt.We think that spicy food can trick our brain when tasting salty food. It makes us taste the same (level of) saltiness even when a reduced amount of salt is actually consumed, said study author Dr. Zhiming Zhu, professor and director of the Department of Hypertension and Endocrinology at the Third Military Medical University in Chongqing, China.In fact, researchers found that people who regularly enjoy spicy foods consumed 2.5 grams less salt in a day (that's 1,000 fewer milligrams of sodium) compared with those who typically steer clear of spice. They also had lower blood pressure.It remains to be seen whether the findings can be replicated in other populations outside China, said Richard David Wainford, associate professor in the Department of Pharmacology at the Boston University School of Medicine, in an accompanying editorial. Still, a lifestyle intervention that adds taste to the diet, in the form of extra spice and flavor, versus reduction of the pleasure given by the salt we add to our food, may have more success as a public health strategy to promote population-level dietary salt reduction, he added.Spice may have the potential to curb sugar cravings too, though the evidence is mixed. involving 40 students from Denmark, when chili pepper was added to sweet, sour and bitter meals, participants experienced a greater desire to eat sweet foods compared with meals without chili added. In another study, also from Denmark, people experienced a  when they ate tomato soup with cayenne pepper compared with eating the soup without pepper. But their desire for sweet and fatty foods significantly increased when they consumed the spicy soup. Capsaicin is the compound in chili peppers that is responsible for the burning sensation we experience when eating them. The compound has the ability to suppress sweet taste, which could also explain some findings. But while some may enjoy the heat that capsaicin produces, it may also come with an unintended consequence. Capsaicin helps fight pain. Most of the time, you hear about this as a topical cream, but eating chili peppers also has benefits. It may be that when the pain goes away, you're stimulated to consume more sweet foods,\u00a0said Mary-Jon Ludy, an associate professor of clinical nutrition at Bowling Green State University. In a meta-analysis, involving , funded by the National Institutes of Health and the McCormick Science Institute, researchers state that the balance of the literature suggests the capsaicin suppresses appetite, though the magnitude of the effects is small. Purposeful inclusion of these compounds in the diet may aid weight management, albeit modestly, the study stated.  (Note that the National Institutes of Health is a federal government agency, and the McCormick Science Institute is an independent research organization that is owned and funded by spice product manufacturer McCormick & Co. Inc. The company said it does not influence the science institute's research priorities.)The meta-analysis included the Danish study that found increased sugar cravings among those who consumed spicy meals. But it also included a study that found adding . In that study, when people added half a teaspoon of red pepper to their lunch, they had a decreased desire to eat sugary, fatty and salty foods, and ate about 70 fewer calories at their next meal. The effects were seen only among those who didn't regularly consume red pepper.I think that there's something in the novelty of the stimulus that would allow you to eat less, said Ludy, who authored the study and the meta-analysis. In terms of the work with red pepper, I think that that's an important piece of the puzzle. If you are adding a spicy meal every couple of weeks, it might be enough to have an effect ... but if you have it every day, the effect goes away, because you get used to it.To get started with spice, Ludy recommends sprinkling red pepper flakes into eggs in the morning. You can also use spice when making a rub for meat or when seasoning vegetables, soups, pasta or curry dishes. She also recommends adding red pepper flakes to a meal in anticipation of a tempting dessert. It may give you that extra piece of security, she said. Though not specific to sweet taste, cinnamon, ginger and saffron are other pungent spices with appetite suppressive effects, according to Ludy.However you choose to use spice, it's wise to start slowly. Remember that a tiny bit of spice\u00a0can go a long way! Ludy said. If the heat is an issue, you can calm your taste buds by pairing hot spices with healthy fats, such as avocados and nuts, according to Ludy. They help break down\u00a0the chemical that causes the burn.If you're new to spicy peppers,\u00a0she recommends starting with milder varieties, such as jalapeno or serrano, which cause less burn than cayenne or habanero. These peppers still contain some capsaicin but not as much. Although I haven't researched it directly, my guess is that there would still be appetite effects (perhaps of a lesser magnitude) ... but if you can't tolerate higher quantities of spice, something is better than nothing, right?Lisa Drayer is a nutritionist, an author and a CNN health and nutrition contributor."},
{"title": "Is dark chocolate healthy?", "cate": "health", "content": "Yes, dark chocolate has compounds that offer health benefits and can be enjoyed without guilt, even on a daily basis. But the portion size matters, since too many bites can contribute extra fat, sugar and calories and negate its health benefits. Dark chocolate is rich in cocoa solids, which contain compounds known as flavanols. At high levels, cocoa flavanols have been shown to help lower blood pressure and cholesterol, improve cognition and possibly lower the risk of diabetes. Dark chocolate has the highest amount of cocoa flavanols; milk chocolate has less, and white chocolate has none. But while cocoa flavanols in dark chocolate make it a healthful treat, they give it a bitter flavor. Manufacturers may process chocolate to make it more palatable, but doing so can . Factors in processing, including fermentation and roasting, which deepen the flavor and give chocolate its distinct aroma, can affect flavanol content, explained Matt Hartings, assistant professor of chemistry at American University.Roasting generates all sorts of new flavors ... and to generate those flavors, you have to destroy molecules in the unroasted bean ... and there is always the chance that it is destroying compounds that we want around, including flavanols, Hartings said. Though the flavanol content may vary among dark chocolate brands, it's still a healthier choice than milk chocolate, which also tends to have more sugar.If you need more justification to enjoy dark chocolate, consider this: A third of the fat in cocoa butter is stearic acid, a saturated fat that, unlike other saturated fats, appears to have a . Additionally, cocoa powder contributes minerals, including calcium, copper, iron, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium and zinc. So feel free to enjoy a piece of dark chocolate after a meal. Just keep a few facts in mind before you indulge.First, buy chocolate that is at least 60% cacao (i.e. cocoa). Generally speaking, the higher the percentage, the more flavanols, though the exact amount varies from batch to batch and depends on the extent of processing, according to Hartings. These higher-percentage chocolates have the added benefit over the lower percentages and milk and white chocolates because they contain less sugar and less fat, he said.Second, if possible, choose natural cocoa over Dutch processed cocoa, which is treated with an alkali, a compound that neutralizes acid. This gives chocolate a milder flavor but removes healthful flavanols.If you are cooking, the ultimate choice of cocoa will depend on the recipe, according to Hartings. Some things are just better if you bake with Dutch processed cocoa, he said. If one ingredient in a recipe is highly acidic, then with natural cocoa, it may be too acidic.And finally, to keep weight in check, limit portions to 1 ounce of dark chocolate daily, or about 150 calories.Lisa Drayer is a nutritionist, an author and a CNN health and nutrition contributor."},
{"title": "A New Year, new food resolution: Water", "cate": "health", "content": "Being adequately hydrated can help to ward off fatigue, keep hunger at bay and boost metabolism. It keeps your body running efficiently, allowing it to work smarter, not harder, said Caroline Passerrello, a registered dietitian and spokeswoman for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.Consider the calorie savings, too: If you replace every 150-calorie can of soda consumed daily with a glass of water, you save more than 1,000 calories per week, which translates to 15 pounds lost over a year. Drinking a glass of water before a meal can help fill you up and eat fewer food calories.In the same way you plan meals, you can plan your water intake. This is especially important for older individuals, for whom thirst can be a poor indicator of one's fluid needs. Additionally, since thirst can be mistaken for hunger, planning to drink throughout the day can help you avoid unnecessary snacking.Carrying a refillable water bottle can serve as a constant reminder to drink more. I used a water bottle that had a hook on it and hooked my keys on it ... so everywhere I go, I now have a water bottle. It becomes part of your routine, Passerrello said.If plain water is unappealing, try adding fruit or vegetable slices such as oranges, lemons, strawberries or cucumber to boost flavor. Carbonated water is another option. There are countless options of flavored sparkling water and seltzer on the store shelves these days. Select ones that are naturally sweetened and have zero calories, Passerrello said. Have a daily water goal. Eight glasses per day is an average number (and doesn't include water from foods); your needs may be more or less depending on your activity level and other factors, like pregnancy.

{"title": "How to succeed at intermittent fasting", "cate": "health", "content": "Intermittent fasting, a dieting approach that involves cycling between periods of eating and abstaining from food, has been trending in diet circles. This is in part because reports claim that celebrities such as Beyonce, Hugh Jackman, Ben Affleck and Nicole Kidman are doing it but also because increasingly more research reveals that the eating pattern may promote weight loss and improve overall health.The method is not appropriate for everyone, however, particularly pregnant women and those with medical conditions such as diabetes or eating disorders. And though studies are promising, it remains to be seen if this type of eating can become a sustainable lifestyle habit instead of a drop-a-dress-size-in-a-week fad. The jury is still out, especially on how healthy, sustainable and realistic this approach is, said Samantha Heller, a registered dietitian and senior clinical nutritionist at NYU Langone Health in New York. Eating very low calories, or none, on alternate days feels punitive to many and may exacerbate an already difficult and complex relationship someone has with food.If you are still hoping to give intermittent fasting a try, there are some things to consider that can increase your chances of reaching your goals. Also, be sure to check with your doctor before starting a fasting regimen.The appeal of intermittent fasting may be related to its simplicity, as it seems to require less effort than restricting calories every day. But there are different approaches to the eating pattern that vary in intensity. One regimen known as time-restricted feeding advises consuming all of your calories within a range of three to 12 hours a day, whereas an approach known as the 5:2 diet advises eating 500 to 600 calories for two days of the week and eating whatever you want on the other five days. A third, much more stringent type of regimen involves alternating 24-hour fasting periods (in which no foods or calorie-containing beverages are consumed) with non-fasting days, during which anything can be eaten in any amount. Though time-restricted feeding might not seem that different from a typical eating day, especially if you tend to skip breakfast, alternate-day fasting may cause intense hunger on fasting days and can be much more challenging to sustain.People who are accustomed to eating regularly scheduled meals or suffer from 'head hunger' may find alternate-day fasting extremely difficult, said Kristen Smith, a registered dietitian and spokeswoman for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. Head hunger is the desire to eat when you are not physically hungry but are triggered to eat by emotions and social factors.For the greatest success, Smith recommends choosing a fasting regimen that best suits your lifestyle, your health history and your ability to sustain fasting. For example, alternate-day fasting may not be appropriate for someone with an active job that requires manual labor or a job that centers around food, such as a chef.Protein and fiber-rich foods will keep you feeling full and satisfied, which is important when calories are strictly limited. Healthy fats such as nuts and peanut butter can also curb hunger but provide a lot of calories for a small portion size.If you are limiting your calories to about 500 to 600 per day, you might focus on one or two mini meals and snacks. Smith recommends a small piece of grilled salmon with half a cup of steamed veggies, grilled chicken over spaghetti squash, an egg-white omelet with veggies or black beans with a cup of veggies. For snacks, she favors fat-free plain Greek yogurt, two cups of plain popcorn, a cup of raw veggie sticks or a medium piece of fruit.High-volume foods such as soups may also help on semi-fasting days, as they can fill you up on fewer calories than solid foods. Additionally, meal replacement bars may provide a convenient option, especially if you don't feel like preparing food on fasting days. Our bodies want to keep us alive. If we are consuming very few calories on certain days, when we do eat, our bodies are going to do everything they can to encourage us to eat a lot because they don't know when the next meal will be available, Heller explained. We also feel that as a reward for sticking to 500 calories or less, we are allowed and 'deserve' to eat large portions of whatever we want, she said. That kind of reward can bring unintended consequences. Overdoing it on a non-fasting day and eating excessive calories may actually lead to consuming an amount of calories you would consume in two days and defeat the purpose of a fasting day, Smith said. In other words, having pancakes with bacon for breakfast, a fried chicken sandwich for lunch and a cheeseburger with fries for dinner on a non-fasting day can stall weight loss and prevent you from reaching your goals.Strenuous exercise, such as cycling, running, high-impact aerobics and weight lifting, is not advised on fasting days because the body does not have the fuel available to sustain rigorous activity, Heller explained. If you want to do some form of physical activity on those days, Smith recommends sticking with walking, stretching or gentle yoga.If you decide to avoid food for any length of time, adequate hydration is important and should be maintained. On a fasting day, someone may be more likely to become dehydrated because they aren't eating regularly scheduled meals, which is a common time people hydrate, Smith said. Foods such as fruits, vegetables and broth-based soups contain significant amounts of water and can help you stay hydrated. Those fasting should be cautious with caffeine-containing beverages, as they may contribute to dehydration, Smith said.If you experience lightheadedness, dizziness, fatigue, nausea, headaches,difficulty concentrating or any other symptoms that regularly interfere with your daily functioning, you should stop fasting.If any of these symptoms occur, it might be a good time to meet with a registered dietitian to discuss other dietary interventions that might be better suited for you, Smith said.Lisa Drayer is a nutritionist, an author and a CNN health and nutrition contributor."},
{"title": "Eat healthier without quitting sugar", "cate": "health", "content": "Not long ago, fat was the evil dietary villain. Before that it was salt. Now the sugar-free diet has exploded onto the health and wellness scene -- and seems to have topped many people's list of New Year's resolutions.Sugar-free diets encourage people to avoid table sugar (sucrose), sweeteners such as honey and maple syrup, refined flours, condiments, soft drinks, sweets and some fruits such as bananas. Some also recommend eliminating or restricting dairy products.The diet's advocates rightly note that  may lead to obesity and therefore increase the risk of type 2 diabetes, heart disease and some cancers.And it's true we are swallowing too much of the sweet stuff, with the  consuming around 20 teaspoons of added sugar a day.But you don't need to quit sugar to lift your game on healthy eating. Quitting sugar is unlikely to improve your health any more than cutting down on ultra-processed foods, eating more vegetables, cooking food from scratch and limiting how much extra sugar you eat and drink.At best, the sugar-free diet is confusing and imposes an arbitrary set of rules that aren't based on scientific evidence. At worst, such a restrictive diet can create food fear or an unhealthy relationship with food.The sugar-free diet is restrictive, with lists of allowed foods (such as whole grains, blueberries and grapefruits) and not allowed foods (such as white bread, bananas and raisins). This inadvertently promotes a diet mentality and causes followers to worry about accidentally eating something that's not allowed.People who  are more likely to diet. This may be because they are worried specifically about their weight, or about the impact certain nutrients have on their health. dieting is not effective over the long term and can lead to greater weight gain over time. The brain interprets dieting and restriction as a , which causes the storage of fat for future shortages.Dieting is stressful. In response to this, our body releases stress hormones such as , which may cause the body to store fat, particularly in the abdominal area.Worrying about food can lead to , anxiety and depression, and is one of the defining features of the condition known as .Orthorexia is the overwhelming preoccupation with eating healthily. People with orthorexia spend a lot of time thinking and worrying about food and eliminating foods that are deemed impure or unhealthy. Some experts suggest this behaviour is a precursor to, or a form of, an eating disorder.Estimates suggest anywhere between  may have the condition. There are no clear diagnostic criteria, which makes it difficult to measure its prevalence.But we know  will experience an eating disorder at some stage in their life. So we need to ensure nutrition advice, however well-intentioned, doesn't promote or encourage disordered eating.Some sugar-free diets advise people to cut out or restrict healthy foods and food groups such as fruit and dairy, without evidence to support their exclusion. This perpetuates the food fear/dietary restriction cycle and may contribute to nutrient deficiencies.These diets also recommend people avoid fruit for a , and then re-introduce a limited list of expensive healthy fruits (such as berries) while avoiding the cheaper unhealthy fruits such as bananas.Whole fruit is a  of fibre, essential vitamins and minerals, as well as antioxidants. Two serves of fruit per day can reduce the risk of developing some cancers, type 2 diabetes and heart disease. Given American adults only consume  for fruit, the advice to restrict fruit further could result in people missing out on these benefits.Many sugar-free followers also avoid plain dairy products such as milk, yoghurt and cheese, due to the assumption these contain sugars.The sugar in plain dairy products is the natural lactose (a carbohydrate), which is nothing to fear. Unnecessarily  may increase the risk of osteoporosis if not replaced with adequate levels of calcium from other sources.Strangely, many of the sugar-free recipes use expensive sugar alternatives -- such as rice malt syrup (due to its low fructose content), maple syrup (which is sometimes allowed and sometimes not) and dates -- to replace sugar.However, these are still sugars and contain the same number of calories per gram as any other sugar. These alternatives offer no additional nutritional benefits other than rice malt syrup, which is a useful option only for those with a fructose malabsorption issue, and dates, which contain fibre.People often eat more of the food containing these alternatives under the , which could lead to unintentional weight gain.people ate about 35% more of a snack when it was perceived as healthy than when it was seen as unhealthy.Eat plenty of plants, enjoy whole grains, beans and legumes. Fruit is your friend -- not your enemy.Most people could probably eat a little less sugar, a little less often, but you don't have to quit it for good to be healthy.Savour every mouthful of that chocolate cake or sometimes food. Turn off technology and eat the cake mindfully, so that your brain can register that you have eaten it. That way you can get pleasure and satisfaction from it, and you won't be craving it again an hour later.No matter how we choose to eat, remember that health is not simply about the number on the scale, the size of our waist, or the foods we avoid. It's also about our psychological health and our relationship with food, which is just as important as our physical health.Tara Leong is a lecturer in nutrition and dietetics at the University of the Sunshine Coast.Copyright 2018 .

{"title": "One-month sugar detox: A nutritionist explains how and why", "cate": "health", "content": "If you've read about the latest wellness trends, you may have entertained the idea of a diet detox. But whether you've considered juicing, fasting or cleansing in an effort to lose weight or improve your well-being, you're probably aware that drastically cutting out foods is not effective as a long-term lifestyle approach to healthy eating. In fact, strict detoxing can cause issues including fatigue, dizziness and low blood sugar. But there is one kind of sustainable detox that is worthwhile, according to some experts. Reducing sugar in your diet can help you drop pounds, improve your health and even give you more radiant skin. Sugar makes you fat, ugly and old, said Brooke Alpert, a registered dietitian and co-author of The Sugar Detox: Lose the Sugar, Lose the Weight -- Look and Feel Great. What we've discovered in the last couple of years is that sugar is keeping us overweight. It's also a leading cause of heart disease; it negatively affects skin, and it leads to premature aging. Here's more bad news: We can't stop consuming sugar. People have a real dependency -- a real addiction to sugar, Alpert said. We have sugar, we feel good from it, we get (the feeling of) an upper, and then we crash and need to reach for more. About 10% of the US population are true sugar addicts, according to Robert Lustig, professor of pediatrics and member of the Institute for Health Policy Studies at the University of California, San Francisco. What's more,  suggests that sugar induces rewards and cravings that are similar in magnitude to those induced by addictive drugs. One of the biggest concerns is the amount of added sugars in our diets, which are often hidden in foods. Although ice cream cake is an obvious source of sugar, other foods that may not even taste sweet -- such as salad dressings, tomato sauces and breads -- can be loaded with the white stuff. People don't realize that seemingly healthy foods are loaded with sugar -- and so we're basically eating sugar all day long, from morning till night, Alpert said. The good news is that even if you're not a true sugar addict, by eliminating sugar from your diet, you can quickly lose unwanted pounds, feel better and have a more radiant appearance. There is no one person who wouldn't benefit by eliminating added sugars from their diets, Lustig said.Children can benefit, too. Lustig's research revealed that when obese children eliminated added sugars from their diets for just nine days,  -- despite no changes in body weight or total calories consumed. But going cold turkey is what works best, at least in the beginning.Early on in my practice, when I would notice that people had real addiction to sugar, we'd start trying to wean them of sugar or limit their intake or eat in moderation ... but the word 'moderation' is so clich\u00e9d and not effective, Alpert said. It was just ineffective to ask people to eat less of something when they're struggling with this bad habit. You wouldn't ask an alcoholic to just drink two beers.What was so successful in getting my clients to kick their sugar habit was to go cold turkey. When they would go cold turkey, I wasn't their favorite person -- but the number one positive effect was that it recalibrated their palate, she said. They could now taste natural sugars in fruits, vegetables and dairy that they used to be so dulled to.So for the first three days on a sugar detox, Alpert recommends no added sugars -- but also no fruits, no starchy vegetables (such as corn, peas, sweet potatoes and butternut squash), no dairy, no grains and no alcohol. You're basically eating protein, vegetables and healthy fats. For example, breakfast can include three eggs, any style; lunch can include up to 6 ounces of poultry, fish or tofu and a green salad, and dinner is basically a larger version of lunch, though steamed vegetables such as broccoli, kale and spinach can be eaten in place of salad. Snacks include an ounce of nuts and sliced peppers with hummus. Beverages include water, unsweetened tea and black coffee.Though they don't contribute calories, artificial sweeteners are not allowed on the plan, either. These little pretty colored packets pack such a punch of sweetness, and that's how our palates get dulled and immune and less reactive to what sweetness really is, Alpert said. Consuming artificial sweeteners causes you not only (to) store more fat, Lustig explained, you also end up overeating later on to compensate for the increased energy storage.Once the first three days of the sugar detox are completed, you can add an apple. By the fourth day, an apple tastes like candy, Alpert said. The onions are sweet! Almonds are sweet! Once you take sugar away from your diet cold turkey, your palate recalibrates, and you start tasting natural sugars again. Starting with day four, you can add one apple and one dairy food each day. Dairy, such as yogurt or cheese, should be full-fat and unsweetened. Fat, fiber and protein slow the absorption of sugar, so taking out fat from dairy will make you absorb sugar faster, Alpert said. You can also add some higher-sugar vegetables such as carrots and snow peas, as well as a daily serving of high-fiber crackers. Three glasses of red wine in that first week can be added, too. During week two, you can add a serving of antioxidant-rich berries and an extra serving of dairy. You can also add back starchy vegetables such as yams and winter squash.For week three, you can add grains such as barley, quinoa and oatmeal, and even some more fruit including grapes and clementines. You can also have another glass of red wine during the week and an ounce of dark chocolate each day.Week three should be quite livable, Alpert said.Week four is the home stretch, when you can enjoy two starches per day, including bread and rice, in addition to high-fiber crackers. Wine goes up to five glasses per week. You can have a sandwich in week four, which just makes things easier, Alpert said. I want people living. Week four is the way to do it.Week four defines the maintenance part of the plan -- though intentional indulgences are allowed, such as ice cream or a piece of cake at a birthday party. Because the addictive behavior is gone, having ice cream once or twice will not send you back to square one, Alpert said. Additionally, no fruit is off-limits once you've completed the 31 days. The whole purpose is to give people control and ownership and a place for these foods in our life, Alpert said.Detoxing from sugar can help you lose weight quickly. We had over 80 testers from all over the country, and they lost anywhere between 5 to 20 pounds during the 31 days, depending on their weight or sugar addiction, Alpert said. Many also noticed that a lot of the weight was lost from their midsection. Belts got looser! Participants also reported brighter eyes, clearer skin and fewer dark circles. They also had more energy and fewer mood swings. I have lost approximately 40 pounds following the sugar detox, said Diane, who preferred not to share her last name. She has been on the plan for approximately two years.I thought I was educated on weight loss, but like many, I was miseducated, and by reducing fat, I was really just adding sugar. With the elimination of sugar, including artificial sweeteners, it is incredible how sweet foods tastes. Diane added back some healthy fats into her diet, which keeps her feeling satisfied. And her sugar cravings disappeared. This is probably the longest I have remained on a plan, and I don't feel like this will change. It just feels natural and normal.There are challenges and medical considerations before starting, though. Since the first few days of a sugar detox can be challenging, it's important to pick three days during which your schedule will be supportive. Depending on how intense your addiction is, you can experience withdrawal symptoms, such as brain fog, crankiness and fatigue, Alpert said. Lustig found that the children in his study experienced anxiety and irritability during the first five days of eliminating sugar and caffeine, though it eventually subsided. If you feel bad, stop and have a piece of fruit. But if you can push through and stay well-hydrated, you can really break your cycle of sugar addiction, Alpert said.It's important to note that the plan may not be appropriate for diabetics, extreme athletes or anyone taking medication to control blood sugar. It is also not recommended for pregnant women.Finally, before starting a sugar detox, enlist the help of friends and/or family members for support. You need people around you to help you be successful, Lustig said. The whole family has to do it together.Lisa Drayer is a nutritionist, author and health journalist. "},
{"title": "Military diet: 3-day diet or dud?", "cate": "health", "content": "Looking for an easy diet to lose a quick few pounds? If you're searching on the Internet, chances are you've stumbled on something called the military diet. It's also known as the Navy diet, the Army diet and sometimes the ice cream diet, because in addition to hot dogs and tuna fish, you get to eat ice cream on all three days of the program. Smells fishy, right? Well, hold your nose. It's about to get really stinky.The military diet is a variation of the ever-popular three-day diet, a crash plan of fill-in-the-blank foods to eat if you want to lose weight fast. These diets typically claim that you can lose about 10 pounds in three days to a week if you follow their blueprint to the letter. The meal plans are usually extremely basic and calorie-restrictive, because let's face it, that's how you lose weight. But are these diets healthy? Will the weight stay off?With this type of low-calorie, lower-carbohydrate diet, you are losing mostly water and potentially some muscle, said , author of Tell Me What to Eat If I Have Diabetes. Water weight drops quickly as the body's glycogen stores decline, which happens when you restrict carbs and calories. Weight will come back when you begin to eat normally again.Could it be that the military diet is different? Here's a breakdown of what's prescribed on days one to three of the military diet, with calories calculated via the US Department of Agriculture's calorie-calculating tool,   Breakfast is a cup of caffeinated coffee or tea, one slice of toast with 2 tablespoons of peanut butter and half a grapefruit. That's 308 calories.Lunch is another cup of coffee or tea, a bare-bones slice of toast (whole-wheat is best, they rightly say) and a half-cup of tuna. This meal is tiny, only 139 calories.Dinner is 3 ounces of any meat (that's about the size of a playing card), a cup of green beans, half of a banana and a small apple (not a large apple, even though the calorie difference is minuscule), but wait: You get a whole cup of vanilla ice cream! If you choose steak instead of a lean chicken breast as your entree, this meal equals 619 calories.But even with the steak and the cup of full-fat ice cream, the day adds up to a mere 1,066 calories. No snacks allowed.If you're used to eating 2,000 to 2,500 calories a day, such a drastic drop will be hard to do, said registered dietitian , who writes about nutrition for CNN. You're going to be tired and irritable, with difficulty concentrating. It will be hard to exercise, and I would think you'll be quite hungry as well.Here's day two's repast. It adds up to only 1,193 calories, even if you pick some higher-fat options. Breakfast is another dry piece of toast, one egg cooked however you like and half of a banana. Let's say you fry your egg in oil. That's 223 calories. Lunch is a hard-boiled egg, five saltine crackers and a cup of cottage cheese. If you choose full-fat cottage cheese, the total is 340 calories.Dinner is half of a banana, a half-cup of carrots, a full cup of broccoli, two hot dogs (that's right!) and another treat: a half-cup of vanilla ice cream. The meal totals 630 calories (if you eat a full-fat pork or beef dog).How does this fare fair?I never recommend hot dogs or any processed meats, Drayer said, because they are associated with a .Ice cream is not a good use of the meager calories, she added. You could have 3 cups of salad and only eat 100 calories, or other nutritious foods that will be satisfying and hold back the hunger. Day three is the most restrictive, only 762 calories. Breakfast is a slice of cheddar cheese with five saltines and a small apple. That's 232 calories. Lunch is grim: one dry slice of toast and an egg. Even if you fry the egg in oil again, that's a total of 170 calories. Dinner is 460 calories and a stomach-turning combination of half a banana, a full cup of tuna and another cup of ice cream. Maybe they think that by now, you're so hungry, you'll be willing to eat those foods together.The websites promoting the military diet say that eating certain food combinations will boost your metabolism.There is no truth behind claims that the food combinations in the first few days will increase your metabolism and burn fat, Magee said. There's no research I know of behind those claims, Drayer agreed.And what about the rest of the week? You round out your week by eating what you like, so long as it's less than 1,500 calories a day. Then you can start on the three-day restrictions again. Best of all, no exercise -- zero, zip, nada -- is said to be needed on this diet. Yet another fad diet that won't lead to healthy or sustainable weight loss! Magee said with passion, adding that exercise is key to lasting weight loss.She also feels there are potential physical and emotional ramifications to diets that restrict and deprive you to this extent.It can lead to weight cycling, a quick loss and regain of weight, that can weaken your immune system, mess with your metabolic rate and increase the risk of other health problems, such as gallstones and heart trouble, Magee said.Why would such a fad diet be associated with the military? According to  , ,  and message board , it was designed by nutritionists in the US military to drop pounds off recruits who otherwise wouldn't measure up. What? In my 30 years working with the military, I've never heard of it, said certified nutrition specialist , professor at the Uniformed Services University and author of the first US Navy SEAL Nutrition guide. We did not develop this. We do not use it. It has absolutely no resemblance to the real military diet. Even our rations are healthier and more nutritionally sound, Deuster said. It looks like they just took the name 'military' and added it to the diet and capitalized on it.An Internet search shows that this very diet -- down to the hot dogs and ice cream -- is also known as the  diet, the  diet, the   diet, the  diet and the   diet. What do they have to say?The Birmingham Hospital Diet did not originate with the University of Alabama at Birmingham, and we do not support or recommend it, university public relations manager Bob Shepard said. This diet has absolutely no connection to UAB Hospital other than the often repeated but false Internet rumors.Oh?It is unfortunate our name has been associated with this diet, the Cleveland Clinic said in a statement. We have never endorsed this meal plan, and it does not meet the standards for what we would consider a healthy diet for heart health or overall well-being.And?The American Heart Association is not -- and never has been -- associated with this diet.This didn't come from us, despite the use of the word Kaiser. Kaiser Permanente supports a balanced diet, rich in fruits, vegetables and whole grains.None of these diets, including the three-day diet, was developed at or ever associated with Mayo Clinic, said Dr. Donald Hensrud, director of the Mayo Clinic Healthy Living Program and medical editor of the  Mayo Clinic Diet. It is likely the originators tried to capitalize on Mayo Clinic's brand recognition as a way of promoting these diets. If you search the Internet for the military diet, you'll probably end up on the top result: . There, you'll find the detailed diet, with pictures and tips on how to make it work for you. There are substitutions, frequently asked questions, a blog, a calorie count, a link to like them on Facebook and a review that fights back against nutritionists who debunk the diet.Oh, and there are lots of ads.But nowhere on the page is there an author, an expert, a nutritional guru. No one takes ownership of this information or gives you any credentials to prove their expertise. That's a red flag, Drayer said. Any helpful diet plan should be created or supported by a credible person or resource or organization. If something is out there without any author or inventor, anyone can say anything and not know how the body works.Trying to track down the owners of three of the most popular military diet sites proved to be a dead end. Emails and calls to listed numbers got no responses.Due to our democratic process, we have a wide-open information environment in the US, said Brian Southwell, editor of a new book on fake news called .  There's no careful censoring of false information.Add to that the fact that science still doesn't have the perfect solution for weight loss and maintenance, he said, and you've got an area that is ripe for exploitation.These dieting sites have a catchy name, the promise of lineage to established institutions, and that is what tends to spread across the Internet, instead of a peer-reviewed study, said Southwell, who directs the Science in the Public Sphere program at the l. And just like direct mail, if you get 5% of people to click through, you can make a huge profit. It doesn't cost much to unleash stuff online. Drayer agreed. I think a lot of people just want to know the next dieting magic bullet, quick fix, and they just go for these fad things.But why are so many of us fooled in the first place?The failure of some people's BS detectors when they encounter fake information can be explained, Southwell said, by what science now knows about how the brain processes data. Instead of sorting the good from bad as the information arrives, the brain accepts it all, and then in another part of the brain, it's tagged as true or false.It leaves open this window of opportunity, he explained, so people believe just long enough and then get tired, distracted, and what happens? They get sucked in. They might be skeptical at first but fail to do the research and think, 'well, maybe this will work. This might be my solution.' The fact that so many of us share our discoveries with friends and loved ones on social accounts fuels the misinformation fire. Southwell calls it social contagion.It's like the dynamics of infectious disease. You've spread the disease before you've even come down with it,  he explained. You find it, you share, you read more and find out that it's not effective, or you try it out and you're disappointed. But the genie is out of the bottle already.According to Southwell, that's exactly what many of these sites are counting on.It doesn't matter if it ultimately gets debunked, because it's going to take a while for it to reach the same numbers of people as the original rumor or fake diet, he explained. And the debunking is not as sexy as the original diet lure. In the meantime, you might see the spread of unhealthy dieting behavior, and for some people with certain diseases or conditions, that can cause real harm, Southwell said, such as heart disease or diabetes. But it can't be traced back. Who is culpable for that?Let's face it. We still want a quick way to lose 5 or 10 pounds fast, just in time for that special occasion. Is it possible to do so in a healthy way?I will prescribe a modified three-day diet just to jump-start weight loss, Drayer said. I typically recommend increasing your water intake and eliminating all starchy carbs like breads, pasta, cereal and rice, as well as sweets and treats for one week. Doing this not only cuts calories, but you also shed some extra water too, which can be motivating as the numbers on the scale go down.For those who drink their calories, Drayer recommends slashing sugary beverages such as sodas, flavored lattes, fruit juices and smoothies, as the calories from these beverages can really add up.  Magee prefers to trick the body into losing weight, to avoid what she calls a starvation backlash.When you decrease your calories so severely as they do in the three-day military diet, your body tends to go into conservation mode and actually burns fewer calories, she said, because it thinks you are entering a potato famine or similar, and it wants to survive. I think it's better to trick your body into burning calories by decreasing the calories you eat a little, increasing exercise to burn more calories, to create a daily deficit of about 250 calories a day, she explains. It's slower but more sustained weight loss, and you are more likely to lose body fat rather than muscle tissue and water.Regardless of what method you try, said Drayer, remember that any diet should be cleared by your nutritionist or doctor before you begin. And when it comes to the three-day military diet, she concluded: I can't imagine any doctor or expert endorsing the military diet as healthy or beneficial in any way."},
{"title": "How to detox from a sodium habit you may not know you have", "cate": "health", "content": "We've covered the many health reasons to. But let's talk about how, especially when it's hidden in many of the foods we love.When cutting back on sodium, it's important to start slowly, as going cold turkey can shock your taste buds. If you try to make chicken soup with no salt, you will notice the difference, said Sonya Angelone, a registered dietitian who specializes in cardiovascular nutrition and is the media spokeswoman for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. Instead, start with half of the amount of salt you would typically use. You can also look for low- or reduced-sodium versions of your favorite foods, or make your own versions, like homemade spaghetti sauce. For example, canned tomato sauce can have 1,000 milligrams of sodium per serving. But canned tomatoes have about 300 milligrams, and tomato paste has very little sodium -- so you can just add water or low-sodium chicken broth to make a sauce, Angelone said.Using herbs and spices can help bring out flavor in foods without salt. Spice blends without salt can come in handy during cooking. You might use a Mexican blend with cumin, chili pepper and smoked paprika for chili, while blends containing rosemary, thyme and oregano might be well suited for Italian dishes, Angelone explained.When dining out, ask for steamed vegetables and fish, and skip the sauces. And when food shopping, compare the sodium values of similar foods. Some rolls can have 400 milligrams; other ones can have 200, Angelone said. Breads and rolls are top sources of sodium in the US diet, according to the , along with cold cuts and cured meats, pizza, soup, sandwiches and poultry. Be sure to look for hidden sources of sodium. Code words for sodium on food labels include fleur de sel, monosodium glutamate  and disodium guanylate. And don't be fooled by different forms of salt, which may appear healthier than they are. Himalyan pink salt or kosher salt or sea salt all have the same amount of sodium, Angelone said. And reduce the amount of processed food you eat. Sodium is a mineral that occurs naturally in foods and enters our diets through processed foods. White salt crystals are technically a combination of sodium and chloride. In fact, by weight, salt is about 40% sodium and 60% chloride.If you sprinkle a teaspoon of salt on your food regularly, cutting it out will eliminate a day's worth of sodium. But that's just skimming sodium's surface, because only 11% of the sodium in our diets comes from the salt shaker, which we may grab during cooking or eating. About 15% of sodium in a typical American diet occurs naturally in foods. But the rest -- more than 70% -- comes from sodium in packaged, prepared and restaurant foods, including canned soups, frozen foods and lunch meats. Some of  to your diet include pizza, cold cuts, burritos, soup, cheese, milk, eggs, rice and cake.  Manufacturers add sodium to help preserve food and enhance the flavor and texture. But they are contributing to our increasingly high sodium intake. If less sodium is added to foods during processing, it's much easier for consumers to cut back. To help Americans achieve recommended sodium levels, the Food and Drug Administration recently for processed foods. In addition to limiting sodium, experts say that focusing on increasing potassium-rich foods is an important part of a salt detox. Sodium stiffens your arteries ... but potassium does the opposite, Angelone said. To maximize your salt detox, Angelone recommendsthat contain a lot of sodium and replacing them with more potassium-rich produce, as well as unsalted nuts, beans and legumes.By eating less salty, processed foods and more simple fresh foods, you are going to automatically consume less sodium and more potassium, she said. Finally, when you choose to consume salty snacks and foods, be sure to savor them. If you are going to have salt, have it in something that really matters. ... It makes food taste good, but make sure it really counts, Angelone said.Lisa Drayer is a nutritionist, an author and a CNN health and nutrition contributor."},
{"title": "Cut calories by 15% to stay young, study says", "cate": "health", "content": "Maybe there's no need for a fountain of youth after all. New by 15% for two years can slow the metabolic process that leads to aging and protect against age-related diseases.After just one year on a reduced-calorie diet, study participants saw their metabolic rates drop significantly. The lowered rate continued into the second year and led to an overall decrease in oxidative stress, a process that has been tied to diabetes, cancer, Alzheimer's disease and other age-related conditions.The study was published Thursday in the . Reducing calorie intake provides health benefits to all people regardless of their current health status, said Leanne M. Redman, lead author of the study and an associate professor at Pennington Biomedical Research Center at Louisiana State University. Animal studies have shown that restricting calories by 25% can extend life. The newCALERIE (Comprehensive Assessment of Long-term Effects of Reducing Intake of Energy) study was designed by Redman, her colleagues and the National Institute on Aging to answer a simple question: Would the same be true in humans?During the first phase, teams of researchers ran small-scale pilot experiments to answer a variety of questions including, what kind of calorie restriction could study participants actually stick to?To this end, some of the pilot studies tested a diet-only calorie reduction, others tested exercise only, and still others tested half-diet, half-exercise.Another question posed by the researchers: What level of calorie restrictions would have an impact on biomarkers of aging?Aging biomarkers are simple biological measurements that differentiate longer-lived people -- those who celebrate birthdays into their 90s and 100s -- from people who live the average life expectancy, Redman said. We know that longer-lived individuals are able to sustain lower blood sugar levels and lower levels of insulin and have lower core body temperature levels in comparison to people who don't live as long as them, she said. After the pilot studies, the National Institute on Aging committed to funding larger phase two CALERIE studies at three universities: Pennington in Baton Rouge, Washington University in St. Louis and Tufts University in Boston.At Pennington, Redman and her colleagues focused on reducing calories by 25% through diet alone. Women between 25 and 45 and men between 25 and 50 were recruited; about half were normal weight and the other half overweight but not obese. Throughout the study, participants ate what they liked, yet they also took vitamins and supplements to ensure that their diets were nutritionally adequate, Redman said.Each participant was also given a scale. Instead of calculating daily calories and slashing them by 25%, weight loss was used to estimate the total reduction in calories for each participant over time. However, the participants did not hit the 25% reduction as anticipated, Redman said: People achieved 15% calorie restriction, actual, over the two years. No matter. The results from this lesser calorie restriction amount were pretty remarkable, she said. For example, participants lost an average of about 20 pounds each by the end of the first year and maintained that loss during the second year.  The calorie-restrictive diet also caused a reduction in sleeping metabolic rate by about 10%, Redman said. This remained true after one year, when weight loss peaked, and after two years, when weight remained constant. A slowed metabolism means the body has become more efficient in using fuel -- whether from food or oxygen -- to derive energy. It's important because every time we generate energy in the body, we generate byproducts, Redman said. These byproducts of normal metabolism, also called oxygen radicals, accumulate in the body and over time cause damage to cells and organs, she explained. And this damage is what has been linked to a shortened lifespan, she said.Not only did calorie restriction slow the metabolism of participants, lower levels of oxidative damage were seen when measured by a compound in urine. Calorie restriction, then, mimicked some of the healthy aging signposts seen in long-lived individuals, Redman said.The big breakthrough with this study, said biologist  of the University of Aberdeen in Scotland and the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, is that it is the first randomized controlled trial of calorie restriction in humans.  Randomized, controlled trials, in which participants are divided by chance into groups to compare interventions, are considered more valuable to scientists than other types of experiments. Speakman, who did not participate in the research but he served on the data safety and monitoring board for the CALERIE project, explained that all previous studies of calorie restriction in humans have been on a voluntary basis. It has been known since the 1930s that calorie restriction reduces the rate of aging and extends lifespan in rodents, Speakman said. Since then, studies in different animals show the same general pattern -- with some exceptions. For example, it doesn't work in houseflies, he said. Plus, the monkey literature is a bit confusing.For this reason, the new study's big contribution is that participants showed two key changes previously observed in calorie-restricted rodents: lowered metabolic rate and reduced production of radical oxygen species, Speakman said.That said, the level of calorie restriction achieved in the new study was rather modest compared to that used in rodents and other animals, he said. This really shows the difficulties in doing calorie restriction work on humans. However, a strength of the new research is that it included extensive measurements of the individual responses.Exactly how calorie restriction prevents aging, Speakman said is the million-dollar question. The research supports two theories of longer life: the rate of living (lower metabolism) and reduced oxidative damage. However, the study shows a correlation only, he said, so we can't infer that these changes are causally linked to reduced aging. Nevertheless it is a step forwards to indicate that these two ideas are not rejected by the current research.Going forward, Redman wants to reconvene the study participants to see whether they're maintaining calorie restrictions and lowered metabolic rates. She also wants to study a group of people from early in their lives until death so she can see the possible long-term results of restricted calorie intake.It's not only the diet, she repeated. It's true that the people who see more sunrises than most of us eat less -- and more healthy -- calories than in a Western diet, Redman said. But what's important is they're living longer and they're free of chronic disease."},
{"title": "An egg a day might reduce your risk of heart disease, study says", "cate": "health", "content": "Eating an egg a day may lower your risk of cardiovascular disease, a study of more than 400,000 adults in China suggests.  Daily egg eaters had an 18% lower risk of dying from cardiovascular disease, which manifests as heart attacks and strokes, compared with adults who avoided eggs, according to thepublished Monday in the journal\u202fHeart.Commonly called heart disease, cardiovascular disease includes heart failure, arrhythmias and heart valve problems in addition to strokes and attacks. Raised blood pressure, carrying too much weight or obesity, and elevated blood sugar all contribute to the risk of cardiovascular disease, which is triggered by unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, smoking and harmful use of alcohol.In the past, doctors sometimes warned patients to avoid . Though eggs contain high-quality protein and other positive nutritional components, they also have high amounts of cholesterol, which was thought might be harmful, explained , a co-author of the study and an associate professor in the Peking University School of Public Health in Beijing.  Yet existing studies on the association between egg and cardiovascular diseases are controversial due to small sample size and limited information, Yu wrote in an email. Past studies have provided only limited evidence from the Chinese population, which have huge differences in dietary habits, lifestyle behaviors and diseases patterns, Yu said.These are among the reasons why he and his colleagues decided to investigate the relationship between eating eggs and cardiovascular disease. To begin, they used information from an ongoing study of half a million adults living in 10 regions of China. They concentrated on 416,213 participants who'd never been diagnosed with cancer, cardiovascular disease or diabetes.Slightly more than 13% of these adults, ranging in age from 30 to 79, said they ate about an egg a day while just over 9% reported never or very rarely enjoying an egg. Nearly all the participants ate chicken, not duck, eggs, Yu noted.Over nearly nine years, the research team tracked this select group. They focused on major coronary events, such as , including hemorrhagic strokes -- when a blood vessel bursts in the brain due, usually, to uncontrolled high blood pressure -- and ischemic strokes -- when a blood vessel feeding the brain becomes blocked, usually by a blood clot.  Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of deaths in China, which accounted for half of the total mortality, Yu said. Stroke, including hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke, is the first cause of premature death, followed by ischemic heart disease.During follow-up, 9,985 people died of cardiovascular disease, and an additional 5,103 major coronary events occurred. Nearly 84,000 other participants were diagnosed with heart disease in this time period.Analyzing the data, the researchers found that eating about an egg a day related to a lower risk of heart disease compared with not eating eggs.In fact, participants who ate up to one egg daily had a 26% lower risk of hemorrhagic stroke, which is more common in China than in the United States or other high-income countries.  Additionally, the egg eaters had a 28% lower risk of dying from this type of stroke.Finally, egg eaters also enjoyed a 12% reduced risk of ischemic heart disease, which is diagnosed in those who show the early signs of gridlocked blood flow to the brain.  Based on the results, Yu said, eating eggs in moderation -- less than one a day -- is associated with a lower incidence of cardiovascular diseases, especially hemorrhagic stroke. Even more, the new research is by far the most powerful project to detect such an effect, he said.On the downside, the research team collected only crude information about egg consumption from participants, and this prevented them from estimating effects more precisely, Yu said. We should [also] be cautious when interpreting our results in a context of different dietary and lifestyle characteristics from China. an assistant professor of agricultural life and environmental sciences at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, said the new study is simply observational and so cannot show a direct cause and effect between eating eggs and risk of heart disease. Saying that, this is a very large study, and that in itself is a strength, and the researchers have done the best possible job to control for other factors, said Richard, who was not involved in the research. Her own  of studies showed that when participants are provided with between six and 12 eggs a week, no change occurs in major cardiovascular risk factors, including higher rates of blood sugar, inflammation and cholesterol.  Several studies in our review observed a positive effect of egg consumption on HDL cholesterol, or good cholesterol, she added. The new study, then, delivers a similar message that egg consumption does not increase the risk of developing a cardiovascular disease, Richard said. Some studies have suggested that consuming eggs increases the risk of diabetes, she said. In this study however, they didn't assess the risk of developing diabetes, which may be because diabetes is a newer disease in the Chinese population and there is not good documentation of who has it, Richard said. Still, she noted, this will be very important data for helping develop dietary prevention guidelines in China.Cardiovascular disease, which takes the lives of 17.7 million people every year, is the leading cause of death and disability worldwide, according to the . Cardiovascular disease causes nearly a third -- 31% -- of all global deaths each year. Overall, I would say that consuming egg as part of a healthy diet does not increase the risk of cardiovascular disease, and we now have another carefully done study to support that, Richard said."},
{"title": "Can a 'fertility diet' really help you conceive? In some cases, yes", "cate": "health", "content": "When it comes to diets, there are many varieties from which to choose: weight loss, plans to lower cholesterol and manage diabetes, and foods to fuel endurance athletes.  Now, there's a diet that claims it can boost a woman's chances of having a baby.The diet was developed by Drs. Jorge Chavarro and Walter Willett, both of the Harvard School of Public Health, based on their extensive data analysis of the Nurses' Health Study, one of the largest and longest-running studies of women's health in America.  After reviewing the diets of more than 18,000 women who did not have a history of infertility but who were trying to get pregnant, they found that the quality of your diet, along with how active you are and whether you smoke, can stack the reproductive deck in your favor. For those having trouble conceiving, high-tech medicine isn't the only answer, Chavarro and Willett wrote in their book, : Groundbreaking Research Reveals Natural Ways to Boost Ovulation and Improve Your Chances of Getting Pregnant.Other experts say Chavarro and Willett's diet may be helpful to improve fertility for women with ovulatory disorders such as polycystic ovary syndrome, often called PCOS.  It is an overall healthy way of eating and can help women improve their intake of key nutrients for conception and pregnancy, said Vandana Sheth, registered dietitian nutritionist and spokeswoman for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. Dr. Marie Menke, assistant professor and director of the division of reproductive endocrinology and infertility at UPMC Magee-Womens Hospital, agreed: If you are going to be searching for a fertility diet, this is a good place to start. Research shows an association between this dietary pattern and a reduced risk of infertility in some women.Experts agree that the diet has positive attributes, but some question whether the real benefit comes from losing weight rather than the quality of one's diet.  Carrying excess pounds can affect egg quality, explained Dr. Amanda Kallen, assistant professor of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive sciences at the Yale Fertility Center.  Also, women who are overweight or obese are more likely to have imbalances in insulin levels, in testosterone levels and in levels of FSH and LSH, and these hormones drive the growth of follicles and ovulation, Kallen explained.  There's definitely data to suggest that coming back to normal weight can help those problems and promote ovulation, but there is not enough data to conclude definitively that one diet helps more than another.  Martha McKittrick, a registered dietitian and PCOS expert, said, I've had many women who lost weight and got pregnant.  The question is, did they get pregnant because they lost weight, or because they followed the other recommendations from the fertility diet?If a woman is overweight and trying to conceive, I try to help them lose weight. That, to me, is number one, McKittrick said. Losing 10% of your weight (or 20 pounds if you weigh 200) improves insulin sensitivity and helps women with PCOS ovulate.But a woman with PCOS can be lean and still be insulin-resistant, which can interfere with ovulation -- in which case the diet quality becomes a more important factor, McKittrick explained.  For these women, eating fewer processed carbs and more whole-grain carbs such as quinoa, farro and whole-wheat bread over white bread can result in a slower rise in blood sugar and a lower insulin production, which is favorable for fertility.   It makes sense for a patient with PCOS to lower her intake of highly processed refined carbs. In some patients, [these] dietary modifications can increase the likelihood of spontaneous ovulation, said Dr. Alan B. Copperman, director of the division of reproductive endocrinology and infertility and vice chairman of the Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Science at Mount Sinai Medical Center.Chavarro and Willett's research reveals that eating more full-fat dairy foods instead of low-fat or fat-free dairy can improve chances of conception among women having trouble ovulating. This is due to the presence of specific hormones in milk fat. But consuming more calories from full-fat foods can get tricky if weight loss is part of one's pregnancy prescription.   I am a fan of 2% or full fat dairy. It's better than skim or 1% if you are trying to get pregnant, and it keeps you feeling full longer, McKittrick said.  But to keep calories in check, she recommends cutting out an ounce of meat or a third of a cup of starch elsewhere in your diet.  Experts say that even if fertility medications or procedures are in the conception cards, improving your diet can optimize your chances of conceiving.  But studies suggest that diets other than the fertility diet may also be beneficial.  In , researchers concluded that diligently following the Mediterranean diet may help increase the chances of a successful pregnancy and birth for women undergoing in vitro fertilization.There is evidence that supports that various dietary patterns support fertility goals; however, most patterns have components in common, such as being rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains and seafood, said Lauren Manaker, an infertility and prenatal dietitian who counsels women and men who want to conceive.  Eating this way will likely not hinder chances of conception versus eating a diet that is common in the Western world, which is rich in refined carbs and processed foods and low in vegetables.  In  published last month and co-authored by Chavarro, a pro-fertility diet that included high levels of folic acid, vitamin B12 and vitamin D, as well as dairy, soy and low-pesticide produce, had a more favorable outcome on fertility when followed in conjunction with assisted reproductive technologies, compared with the Mediterranean diet.  With the pro-fertility diet, the more compliant a patient was, the better the result.  But researchers did not see the same relationship when they evaluated women with different levels of compliance with the Mediterranean diet and their assisted reproductive technology outcomes, Manaker explained.  This new study highlights that components that are not included in the Mediterranean diet, like focusing on low pesticide residue produce and including supplementation of specific vitamins, may be a better choice for those undergoing ART, Manaker said.Although following fertility diet strategies can boost your chances of a baby bump, it's not an automatic 'you do this and your live birth rate goes up 10%,'  Menke said.  What's more, if you don't have an underlying ovulatory disorder, you may not get a lot of added benefit through diet.  Kallen points out that while there is a possibility of benefit from following the fertility diet for women with ovulatory infertility, the data supporting it is based on relationships (which don't prove cause and effect), as well as self-reported accounts of one's diet (which can be inaccurate).  The question is: If you follow this diet, will it treat or cure infertility?  I don't think you can say that's the case, Kallen said.  Copperman noted, If you follow this diet, it doesn't mean you're going to get pregnant, and if you cheat, it doesn't mean that you're not going to get pregnant. It was a lovely study, and it was a huge study; there are tons of women who recorded their information ... but even in the world of big data, it doesn't mean that we can draw specific and personalized conclusions from a study that wasn't designed to ask these questions.Copperman is concerned that women may become overly adherent to a specific diet -- and unnecessarily blame their infertility on not following something stringently enough.  People come in all the time ... after we put them on a low-carb diet ... and then they say, 'the reason I didn't ovulate is because I had a roll at dinner.' No, no! Biologically, that makes no sense, Copperman said.If you decide to try lifestyle changes, your age should also be considered.  If a woman is 26 years old, [not ovulating] for the last three years after she started eating unhealthy in college and became 10 pounds heavier, then I might say, 'try this first; don't go straight to IVF.'  But I'd be cautious to wait a year on a diet if a woman is 40 years old. That would make me a little bit worried, Menke said.  At the end of the day, experts agree that when it comes to conceiving, having something in a patient's control is meaningful.    It's a question that comes up a lot: Is there anything I should be eating or doing to make this better? Menke said. If you are looking for something anyway, this might not be a bad place to start. Chavarro and Willett recommend in their book 10 research-based strategies that could potentially boost fertility:  1. Avoid trans fats, the artery-clogging fats found in many commercially prepared products and fast foods. 2. Use more unsaturated vegetable oils, such as olive oil or canola oil. 3. Eat more vegetable protein, like beans and nuts, and less animal protein. 4. Choose whole grains and other sources of carbohydrates that have lower, slower effects on blood sugar and insulin rather than highly refined carbohydrates that quickly boost blood sugar and insulin. 5. Drink a glass of whole milk or have a small dish of ice cream or full-fat yogurt every day; temporarily trade in skim milk and low- or no-fat dairy products like cottage cheese and frozen yogurt for their full-fat cousins. 6. Take a multivitamin that contains folic acid and other B vitamins. 7. Get plenty of iron from fruits, vegetables, beans and supplements, but not from red meat. 8. Beverages matter: Water is great; coffee, tea and alcohol are OK in moderation; stay away from sugared sodas. 9. Aim for a healthy weight. If you are overweight, losing between 5% and 10% of your weight can jump-start ovulation. 10. If you aren't physically active, start a daily exercise plan. If you already exercise, pick up the pace of your workouts. But don't overdo it, especially if you are quite lean. Too much exercise can work against conception. 11. If you smoke: stop. Chavarro and Willett say the diet recommendations are specific to women with ovulation-related infertility and not infertility related to blocked fallopian tubes or low sperm production.  Their book offers a week-long meal plan with recipes that are consistent with the above strategies and delivers approximately 2,000 calories per day.Lisa Drayer is a nutritionist, an author and a CNN health and nutrition contributor.

{"title": "Do skinny people have faster metabolisms? Not really", "cate": "health", "content": "It might seem counterintuitive, but generally speaking, skinny people don't have faster metabolisms than people who weigh more.  In fact, the bigger your body, the more calories you burn.   Basal (or resting) metabolism refers to the total number of calories all the cells in the body need to stay alive and functioning.  Your resting metabolic rate is typically described as the total number of calories your body needs while at rest. This is made up of basic functions like supporting your vital organs, muscle and fat tissue and the energy that is required to break down food we eat, said Martin Binks, director of the Nutrition & Metabolic Health Initiative at Texas Tech University.  Your total calorie requirement includes these plus what's needed to move around, he added. Therefore, by nature of having more mass, a larger person burns more calories. Melissa Majumdar, registered dietitian, personal trainer and senior bariatric dietitian at Brigham and Women's Center for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery, put it this way: If we kept two people still in a bed with different body weights, the heavier person will burn more.This biological reality also explains why, after you lose an initial amount of weight -- say 10 or 20 pounds -- it's harder to continue losing weight. At a lower body weight, you burn fewer calories, and so the amount of energy, or calories, you once required decreases.  That means you need to consume fewer and fewer calories to continue losing weight.All of this relates to what is known as our basal or resting metabolism, which is directly related to our body weight. But other factors contribute as well, including our body composition, or the amount of lean muscle versus fat mass.  Although the exact number of calories burned by muscle versus fat is quite variable among individuals, fat is not very metabolically active -- meaning it takes very few calories to keep fat tissue alive: specifically one to two calories per pound per day, compared with muscle, which is often thought to burn between five and 13 calories per pound per day, according to Binks.   At a given body weight, someone with a higher amount of lean mass -- which includes connective tissue, muscle and bone -- will burn more calories than someone with less lean mass.  Think of an athlete and a non-athlete with identical body weights; the athlete with a more muscular build will have a higher metabolism.Similarly, a lean, muscular person who weighs 120 pounds may have a healthy amount of lean mass and a relatively fast metabolism.  But another 120-pound person may have a lot less lean mass and more body fat and therefore a slow metabolism.In fact, it is possible to have normal-weight obesity -- a term used when referring to a person who appears thin but who is not very active and therefore has very little muscle mass, Majumdar explained. We know that someone's appearance doesn't tell the whole story and that nutrition and exercise are important for even the naturally thin person in preventing chronic disease, Majumdar said.Our basal or resting metabolic needs, which are based on body weight, body composition and other factors, address only one variable involved in determining how many calories we burn.   Another important determiner of the total amount of calories we burn is the amount of physical activity we engage in.  It's not metabolism per se, but it's significant, because it can vary greatly depending on how active we are and determines how many calories we need to eat each day in order to maintain our body weight.  In addition to body composition, it's one of the factors we can change if we want to lose weight.  While we may not have control over genetic factors that influence metabolism, physical activity -- both through exercise and everyday movements -- can account for 15% to 30% of metabolic needs, Majumdar said. Don't like going to the gym for a high-impact cycling class?  You don't necessarily need to, as long as you don't sit still for periods of time.  NEAT, or , is the energy expended for everything we do that is not sleeping, eating or sports-like exercise, and it includes walking and fidgeting.   NEAT may have a significant effect on weight management and vary up to 2,000 calories per day for some individuals, Majumdar explained. In other words, even small movements throughout the day can add up and contribute to your total calorie burn.  Interestingly, our genetic makeup may play more of a role than we think in terms of determining our body weight.  found that healthy thin people are generally thin because, fortuitously, they have fewer genetic variants that are known to increase our chances of becoming overweight.These people may have no obvious metabolic rate difference, but they probably have a genetic makeup such that they may eat less or metabolize things in a different way, said Dr. Steven Heymsfield, a professor in the metabolism and body composition laboratory at the Pennington Biomedical Research Center, who was not involved in the study. The genes are stacked in their favor.If you feel that your genes aren't working in your favor, the good news is that there are things you can do to boost your metabolism and burn more calories.  Start by building and maintaining lean body mass, which tends to decrease with age.  This can be accomplished through resistance exercises like weightlifting, Binks explained.  And keep moving, even if it means getting out of your chair every 30 minutes and doing a yoga stretch or taking a walk around the office.  It all counts, which is pretty neat!

{"title": "Can you eat your way to better mental health? Study says yes", "cate": "health", "content": "It is well known that eating lots of fruit and vegetables is good for your physical health, but our  suggests that it might be good for your mental health too.A study from  in 2016 found improvements in psychological well-being after increases in fruit and vegetable consumption. We wanted to know if this finding held true using a larger sample (more than 40,000 participants) from the UK Household Longitudinal Study.Our analysis showed that increases in the consumption of fruit and vegetables are linked to increases in self-reported mental well-being and life satisfaction in data that spans a five-year period, even after accounting for other determinants of mental well-being such as physical health, income and consumption of other foods.The benefits of physical activity for  are well established. The estimates from our work suggest that adding one portion to your diet per day could be as beneficial to mental well-being as going for a walk on an extra seven to eight days a month. One portion is equal to one cup of raw vegetables (the size of a fist), half a cup of cooked vegetables or chopped fruit, or one piece of whole fruit. This result is encouraging as it means that one possible way to improve your mental health could be something as simple as eating an extra piece of fruit every day or having a salad with a meal.It is important to stress that our findings alone cannot reveal a causal link from fruit and vegetable consumption to increased psychological well-being. And we can't rule out so-called substitution effects. People can only eat so much in a day, so someone who eats more fruits and vegetables might just have less room in their diet for unhealthy foods. Although we accounted for bread and dairy in our study, ideally, future research should track all other foods consumed to rule out alternative explanations.But when taken in combination with other studies in this area, the evidence is encouraging. For example, conducted in New Zealand found that various measures of mental well-being, such as motivation and vitality, improved in a treatment group where young adults were asked to eat two extra portions of fruit and vegetables a day for two weeks, although no changes were found for depressive symptoms, anxiety or mood.Though our own study cannot rule out that people with higher levels of mental well-being might be eating more fruits and vegetables as a result, a  on our work by the authors of the 2016 Australian study sheds further light on this. The authors show that the number of fruit and vegetable portions eaten in a day can predict whether someone is diagnosed with depression or anxiety two years later. But the reverse does not seem to be true. Being diagnosed with depression does not appear to be a strong predictor of fruit and vegetable consumption two years later. This suggests that it is perhaps more likely that eating fruits and vegetables is influencing mood and not the other way around.Although several studies, including our own, have found a link between fruit and vegetable consumption and mental well-being, we need large trials to provide robust evidence that the link is causal. However, randomised controlled trials are expensive, so another way to identify causation is to focus on the biological mechanisms that link the chemicals commonly found in fruit and vegetables to physical changes in the body. For example, vitamins C and E have been shown to lower  linked to depressive mood.Although more research is needed, our work adds weight to a growing body of evidence that eating fruits and vegetables and having higher levels of mental well-being are positively related, and the signs of a causal link from other recent studies are encouraging. We are not suggesting eating fruits and vegetables is a substitute for medical treatment, but a simple way to improve your mental health could be to add a little more fruit and veg to your daily diet.Neel Ocean is a research fellow in behavioral economics and Peter Howley is an associate professor of economics at the University of Leeds.

{"title": "Why is bacon so addictive?", "cate": "health", "content": "If foods were granted awards, bacon wouldn't rank high for healthfulness, but it might win top prize in the favorite foods category.Full disclosure: I don't eat bacon.  But apparently, I'm in the minority.  Bacon is too perfect for words, said Gail Vance Civille, founder and president of Sensory Spectrum, a consulting firm that helps companies learn how sensory cues drive consumer perceptions of products.  I actually have a friend who is a vegetarian, and she eats only vegetarian food except for bacon. And the reason is because it tastes so good.In , bacon ranked in the middle range of foods that were self-reported as associated with indicators of food addiction. Bacon is just that perfect combo of the sweet, the salty, the smoky and the savory character. Within savory, you've got the cured meat ... the roasted browned fat. ... It's just this perfect combination of ingredients that goes right to the brain, which says, 'take another bite,'  said Linda Papadopoulos, owner of LP & Associates and a sensory and consumer research expert who managed the sensory evaluation group at Oscar Mayer for seven years, helping to ensure that the company's bacon was consistently pleasing to consumers.Another element of bacon's irresistible appeal is its distinctive scent.  It just fills the home with this wonderful savory, smoky aroma. It just makes you feel good,  she said.Then there's the nostalgia aspect.  For most of us, I'd say bacon conjures up some very nice experiences as children ... with bacon being prepared for breakfast at home.  And I think that carries over into our desire to enjoy it for the rest of our lives, said Andrew Milkowski, who spent about 30 years in the research and development department at Oscar Mayer, where he worked with Papadopoulos to help ensure product consistency for the processing of bacon. Bacon has a lot of salt, a fair amount of sugar, and it's very fatty, Civille said.   Its flavor profile includes sweet caramelized notes, from cured and caramelized browned pork fat and browned meat and added sugar, along with things added like smoke and maple, that make it very, very complex, according to Civille.The savory flavor of bacon results from the cured meat interacting with salt and smoke as well as the aroma that's produced, which is a big part of flavor, Milkowski said.Bacon originates from the belly of a pig.  The flesh is injected with a solution containing water, salt, sugar and some cure (which includes sodium nitrite and sodium ascorbate), explained Milkowski, who is also a meat science professor at the University of Wisconsin.  The curing solution imparts flavor and is left to marinate in the pork for a few hours to several days before it is hung in a smokehouse, where smoke is introduced while the bacon is heated.   The warmer the bacon gets, the faster the flavors start to develop.   The smoking process can take two to four hours or up to 24 hours; it depends on the company and what its idea of quality bacon is, Milkowski explained.  But smoking bacon meat is an art, and it's important to achieve the right balance of salt, sweet, meaty and browned fat aromatic, Papadopoulos said.  The bacon is then chilled, sliced and distributed.  These processing methods describe the flavor derived from the curing injection and the smoking process.  But there's even more flavor that develops during the cooking of bacon.It may seem paradoxical, but although bacon is high in fat before you fry it, much of the fat is rendered out when you cook it.  When you are typically done frying [bacon], you have a third of what you started with, and most of what you lost is fat and moisture. You are left with lean [protein] and some fat, carbohydrates and the salt, Milkowski said.Still, the presence of fat during cooking is what delivers a lot of the flavor notes in bacon, experts say, as it functions as an agent in releasing other flavor notes, specifically caramelized, sweet aromatic notes.When you are cooking it at a high temperature, you are breaking down the fat and melting it from a solid state to a liquid like a vegetable oil, and when it gets hotter, it reacts with the other parts of the food, and that's where even more flavor is generated, Milkowski said.  You are cooking at a pretty high temperature and generating different flavors than with other more massive pieces of meat, which never get to that temperature.Civille noted that Oscar Mayer bacon has a very flavorful cure, a sweet aromatic and a uniform smoke note.  It has sort of become the American standard expectation for bacon, Civille said.  Flavor variations of bacon include peppered bacon, applewood, chicory, maple and wood smoke options, which are derived from woods that impart their own unique flavor notes.  You can get very, very fancy with the smokes and the cures, Civille said.  Slice thickness can vary, as well.  Thinner cuts tend to be more crispy and crunchy, but thicker cuts are chewier.Bacon strips are often enjoyed as a breakfast side dish, but its flavor and texture can make it a welcome ingredient,  adding excitement to scallops or imparting a smoky, cured, sweet flavor to a BLT with fresh tomato and lettuce.  Thicker-cut bacon can also add some pizzazz to an otherwise healthy meal.  For example, when you have something bitter like Brussels sprouts, the bacon just adds additional salt, sweet and browned notes, Civille said.  It also adds crispiness and crunch that complement and contrast with the Brussels sprouts' flavor and texture.Use bacon as topping on your salad ... and to impart flavor in beans or your greens, like collard greens with bacon -- oh, YUM! Papadopoulos exclaimed.Considering that too much bacon can be an , consuming bacon as an ingredient -- or as infrequently as possible in its whole form -- might be a satisfactory compromise, assuming you are addicted to the food.  I am the daughter of a dietitian ... and my personal opinion is, we need to focus on a balanced diet and focus on the positive attributes that food can bring to our health status, as opposed to 'what bad is it imparting to me?  Papadopoulos said.We did have bacon on occasion. It was definitely a treat, she said.  It has such a great flavor profile and that crispy crunchy texture, and the way it releases the flavor.  It's a comfort food -- and you need to have those comfort foods in your diet.Lisa Drayer is a nutritionist, an author and a CNN health and nutrition contributor. "},
{"title": "CNN Exclusive: California launches investigation following stunning admission by Aetna medical director", "cate": "health", "content": "California's insurance commissioner has launched an investigation into Aetna after learning a former medical director for the insurer admitted under oath he never looked at patients' records when deciding whether to approve or deny care.California Insurance Commissioner Dave Jones expressed outrage after CNN showed him a transcript of the testimony and said his office is looking into how widespread the practice is within Aetna.If the health insurer is making decisions to deny coverage without a physician actually ever reviewing medical records, that's of significant concern to me as insurance commissioner in California -- and potentially a violation of law, he said.Aetna, the nation's third-largest insurance provider with 23.1 million customers, told CNN it looked forward to explaining our clinical review process to the commissioner.The California probe centers on a deposition by Dr. Jay Ken Iinuma, who served as medical director for Aetna for Southern California from March 2012 to February 2015, according to the insurer. During the deposition, the doctor said he was following Aetna's training, in which nurses reviewed records and made recommendations to him. Jones said his expectation would be that physicians would be reviewing treatment authorization requests, and that it's troubling that during the entire course of time he was employed at Aetna, he never once looked at patients' medical records himself. It's hard to imagine that in that entire course in time, there weren't any cases in which a decision about the denial of coverage ought to have been made by someone trained as a physician, as opposed to some other licensed professional, Jones told CNN. That's why we've contacted Aetna and asked that they provide us information about how they are making these claims decisions and why we've opened this investigation.The insurance commissioner said Californians who believe they may have been adversely affected by Aetna's decisions should contact .Members of the medical community expressed similar shock, saying Iinuma's deposition leads to questions about Aetna's practices across the country.Oh my God. Are you serious? That is incredible, said Dr. Anne-Marie Irani when told of the medical director's testimony. Irani is a professor of pediatrics and internal medicine at the  and a former member of the American Board of Allergy and Immunology's board of directors.This is potentially a huge, huge story and quite frankly may reshape how insurance functions, said Dr. Andrew Murphy, who, like Irani, is a renowned fellow of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology. He recently served on the academy's board of directors.The deposition by Aetna's former medical director came as part of a lawsuit filed against Aetna by a college student who suffers from a rare immune disorder. The case is expected to go to trial later this week in California Superior Court. Gillen Washington, 23, is suing Aetna for breach of contract and bad faith, saying he was denied coverage for an infusion of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) when he was 19. His suit alleges Aetna's reckless withholding of benefits almost killed him.Aetna has rejected the allegations, saying Washington failed to comply with their requests for blood work. Washington, who was diagnosed with common variable immunodeficiency, or CVID, in high school, became a new Aetna patient in January 2014 after being insured by Kaiser. Aetna initially paid for his treatments after each infusion, which can cost up to $20,000. But when Washington's clinic asked Aetna to pre-authorize a November 2014 infusion, Aetna says it was obligated to review his medical record. That's when it saw his last blood work had been done three years earlier for Kaiser.Despite being told by his own doctor's office that he needed to come in for new blood work, Washington failed to do so for several months until he got so sick he ended up in the hospital with a collapsed lung.Once his blood was tested, Aetna resumed covering his infusions and pre-certified him for a year. Despite that, according to Aetna, Washington continued to miss infusions.Washington's suit counters that Aetna ignored his treating physician, who appealed on his behalf months before his hospitalization that the treatment was medically necessary to prevent acute and long-term problems.Aetna is blaming me for what happened, Washington told CNN. I'll just be honest, it's infuriating to me. I want Aetna to be made to change.During his videotaped deposition in October 2016, Iinuma -- who signed the pre-authorization denial -- said he never read Washington's medical records and knew next to nothing about his disorder.Questioned about Washington's condition, Iinuma said he wasn't sure what the drug of choice would be for people who suffer from his condition.Iinuma further says he's not sure what the symptoms are for the disorder or what might happen if treatment is suddenly stopped for a patient.Do I know what happens? the doctor said. Again, I'm not sure. ... I don't treat it.Iinuma said he never looked at a patient's medical records while at Aetna. He says that was Aetna protocol and that he based his decision off pertinent information provided to him by a nurse.Did you ever look at medical records? Scott Glovsky, Washington's attorney, asked Iinuma in the deposition.No, I did not, the doctor says, shaking his head.So as part of your custom and practice in making decisions, you would rely on what the nurse had prepared for you? Glovsky asks.Correct.Iinuma said nearly all of his work was conducted online. Once in a while, he said, he might place a phone call to the nurse for more details.How many times might he call a nurse over the course of a month?Zero to one, he said.Glovsky told CNN he had never heard such explosive testimony in two decades of deposing insurance company review doctors.Aetna defended Iinuma, who is no longer with the company, saying in its legal brief that he relied on his years of experience as a trained physician in making his decision about Washington's treatment and that he was following Aetna's Clinical Policy Bulletin appropriately.Dr. Iinuma's decision was correct, Aetna said in court papers. Plaintiff has asserted throughout this litigation that Dr. Iinuma had no medical basis for his decision that 2011 lab tests were outdated and that Dr. Iinuma's decision was incorrect. Plaintiff is wrong on both counts. In its trial brief, Aetna said: Given that Aetna does not directly provide medical care to its members, Aetna needs to obtain medical records from members and their doctors to evaluate whether services are 'medically necessary.' Aetna employs nurses to gather the medical records and coordinate with the offices of treating physicians, and Aetna employs doctors to make the actual coverage-related determinations.In addition to applying their clinical judgment, the Aetna doctors and nurses use Aetna's Clinical Policy Bulletins ('CPBs') to determine what medical records to request, and whether those records satisfy medical necessity criteria to support coverage. These CPBs reflect the current standard of care in the medical community. They are frequently updated, and are publicly available for any treating physician to review.Jones, the California insurance commissioner, said he couldn't comment specifically on Washington's case, but what drew his interest was the medical director's admission of not looking at patients' medical records.What I'm responding to is the portion of his deposition transcript in which he said as the medical director, he wasn't actually reviewing medical records, Jones told CNN.He said his investigation will review every individual denial of coverage or pre-authorization during the medical director's tenure to determine whether it was appropriate or not for that decision to be made by someone other than a physician.If the probe determines that violations occurred, he said, California insurance code sets monetary penalties for each individual violation.CNN has made numerous phone calls to Iinuma's office for comment but has not heard back. Heather Richardson, an attorney representing Aetna, declined to answer any questions. Asked about the California investigation, Aetna gave this written statement to CNN:We have yet to hear from Commissioner Jones but look forward to explaining our clinical review process.Aetna medical directors are trained to review all available medical information -- including medical records -- to make an informed decision. As part of our review process, medical directors are provided all submitted medical records, and also receive a case synopsis and review performed by a nurse.  Medical directors -- and all of our clinicians -- take their duties and responsibilities as medical professionals incredibly seriously. Similar to most other clinical environments, our medical directors work collaboratively with our nurses who are involved in these cases and factor in their input as part of the decision-making process.Dr. Arthur Caplan, founding director of the division of medical ethics at New York University Langone Medical Center, described Iinuma's testimony as a huge admission of fundamental immorality.People desperate for care expect at least a fair review by the payer. This reeks of indifference to patients, Caplan said, adding the testimony shows there needs to be more transparency and accountability from private, for-profit insurers in making these decisions.Murphy, the former American Academy of Allergy Asthma and Immunology board member, said he was shocked and flabbergasted by the medical director's admission. This is something that all of us have long suspected, but to actually have an Aetna medical director admit he hasn't even looked at medical records, that's not good, said Murphy, who runs an allergy and immunology practice west of Philadelphia.If he has not looked at medical records or engaged the prescribing physician in a conversation -- and decisions were made without that input -- then yeah, you'd have to question every single case he reviewed. Murphy said when he and other doctors seek a much-needed treatment for a patient, they expect the medical director of an insurance company to have considered every possible factor when deciding on the best option for care.  We run into the prior authorization issues when we are renewing therapy, when the patient's insurance changes or when an insurance company changes requirements, he said.Dealing with these denials is very time consuming. A great deal of nursing time is spent filling and refilling out paperwork trying to get the patient treatment.If that does not work, then physicians need to get involved and demand medical director involvement, which may or may not occur in a timely fashion -- or sometimes not at all, he said. It's very frustrating."},
{"title": "Inside the secret lives of functioning heroin addicts", "cate": "health", "content": "They're not slumped over in alleyways with used needles by their sides. Their dignity, at least from outside appearances, remains intact. They haven't lost everything while chasing an insatiable high. They are functioning heroin addicts -- people who hold down jobs, pay the bills and fool their families. For some, addiction is genetic; they're wired this way. For others, chronic pain and lack of legal opioids landed them here. Or experimentation got them hooked and changed everything.What addicts have in common, according to experts, is a disease that has more to do with their brains than the substances they use. About 85% of people can take a pain pill, for example, and never crave it again.This is a story about the others, those traveling the dangerous road of functional addiction. What works for them now, experts explain, can easily and lethally be derailed. Hanging in the balance are people you may never imagine: peers, co-workers and neighbors. Loved ones, bosses and teachers. Respected members of your community who, for the benefit of everyone's understanding, want to be heard. After CNN gave voice last fall to, the sorts we think of when we picture heroin addict, I set out to tell this overlooked part of the heroin story. Being a functioning addict hinges on heroin use staying hush-hush, so we agreed to change the names of those willing to open up. Loving and successful parents, good schools, a great upbringing in the Midwest: Todd can't point to anything that drove him to drugs. He was a typical suburban high school student who dabbled in weed. Then, at 15, he popped a Percocet his mother left lying around while she was recovering from surgery. The feeling in my head was, 'I want to feel like this for the rest of my life,'  Todd says. It was the perfect drug for me.The 11 years since have been a dance with opioid addiction, even as he graduated from college and embarked on a successful career in corporate management. Now 26, he has gone stretches where he's been sober, but the pull is strong and keeps yanking him back. He's done heroin for periods of time and says it's fantastic, but shooting up isn't his style. His preference, assuming he can find them, is to buy more expensive opioids. For a long time, OxyContin was his drug of choice; now he prefers Opana and, if he can't get that, Subutex. He makes good money, which means he can afford his $350- to $600-a-week habit. He's figured out how much to take so he doesn't feel the pains of withdrawal, which is now his goal -- rather than getting a full-on high. His sweet spot: 60 milligrams of Opana. I don't know how to describe withdrawal. It's like the worst flu you've ever had in your life -- and then multiply that by 1,000, he says. There's a scraping inside your brain. You're willing to do anything to feel better. To avoid that hell, Todd often lives a lie. He's all smiles and happiness at work, he says, and he spins tales to guard his secret. He might say he's in one city when he's really in another. That quick trip he says he's taking to McDonald's could be to meet his dealer at Burger King. When he's used heroin, he's explained the bruises on his arm by telling people he has diabetes or an infectious disease. He once told a pharmacist he was a science teacher in need of syringes for experiments. He's invented the deaths of family members to get days off. But death is very much a reality in his life.His last serious girlfriend also used drugs and died from an overdose. Over the past six years, he's lost seven people he cares about to addiction. He'd like to find love, build a relationship and have a family but says, It would be dishonest, and I never want to hurt anybody. That's the biggest problem.He knows that he has a lot to live for, but he often forgets that and struggles to imagine a future. And because he can't stray far from his dealer, a dream he does have remains on hold indefinitely. I've always wanted to see the world, he says. I've never been outside the country because I can't leave. I'm f***ing chained where I'm at. It's a f***ing prison. The sensation Todd had the first time he popped a Percocet, that feeling he wanted to hold onto for the rest of his life, was the giveaway. He, like 10% or 15% of people, has the disease of addiction, explains Dr. Stuart Gitlow, past president of the . What offers no special high for most people or may even make them feel queasy became Todd's aspiration. And part of the problem, says Gitlow, is that you don't know in advance what person you're going to be.Todd may be functioning now, but Gitlow warns that tolerances and doses often change. As an addictive disease progresses, it is also influenced by life events and stressors. What happens if Todd loses his job someday or can't afford his preferred pills?They all start out functioning, he says. The bulk of people taking heroin are probably functioning. It's only in the end stage that they're nodding off in an alley and have a pretty good shot of dying. What Todd needs, Gitlow says, is help from a doctor who is certified in addiction medicine and can treat his disease. The vast majority, or 80%, of those who seek appropriate treatment and adhere to their treatment recommendations do well, he says.It didn't start with a pill for Lisa. Her first addiction took hold at 12, when she began cutting herself. Carving into her flesh released dopamine in her brain, giving her a high, she says. The first time she did it, she never anticipated a rush. She was overwhelmed emotionally and simply acting out. But cutting became her way to self-medicate because it offered her solace, easing the emotional pain of living in a household full of screaming.Now, at 23, Lisa opts for heroin. And because of it and other opioids she's used, I hurt myself a lot less. The difference now is that she, like Todd, no longer seeks a high. When she shoots up each morning, she insists, I just do enough to stay well through the day and not feel physical pain. She works hard, always has. She excelled in her college-prep private school, where she was dubbed gifted and talented, she says. She takes her job as a store manager seriously and enjoys a supportive marriage. No one at work knows that her day begins with a call to her dealer. If she has track marks, a simple long-sleeved shirt hides the evidence.How she found heroin, she says, is not unique. Long plagued by tendonitis in her knees and two herniated discs in her back, Lisa tried everything. Steroid injections gave her migraines, and her stomach couldn't handle anti-inflammatories. Physical and aquatic therapies offered little relief, as did deep-tissue massage. Finally, four years ago, a physician wrote out a prescription for pain pills. She found comfort in those legal opioids. But then came the crackdown on opioid prescriptions, she says, effectively ending her lawful pain management. Once her pills ran out, she turned to buying them on the street. They were hard to find, though, and the cost became prohibitive. An old friend, a heroin user, suggested that she give his drug a try.I can't find pills, I'm in pain, and it's really cheap, she remembers telling herself. What happened to me is what happened to thousands and thousands of people.Where she lives in Texas, near the Mexican border, the price of heroin can't be beat. One pill might cost her $50, but she can get half a gram of heroin, which is far more potent, for $20. The same product, she says, would cost up to five times as much in other parts of the country. If I moved somewhere where it was $100, she says, I'd quit.Her husband doesn't do drugs. He barely drinks. And although he'd prefer she kick the habit altogether, he's committed to being by her side -- so much that he keeps Narcan, the overdose antidote drug, in their home and has watched training videos to learn how to administer it in case she overdoses.He loves me enough that he's willing to stay with me, Lisa says. That's a key component to keeping me from going off the deep end. Lisa says a small handful of friends know that she uses heroin. Everyone else, her family included, believes she's hooked on just pills. It's easier that way. Pills and other vices don't come with the same sort of judgment.People drink, and we think nothing of it. You do heroin, and you're the scum of the earth, she says. People will cut you out of their lives. Heroin users weren't always the scum of the earth. In the late 19th century, it was a trademark name for an over-the-counter drug made by Bayer. Today, there are politics behind which drugs are demonized and which aren't, and much of that is rooted in racism, says Dr. Michael Miller, who preceded Gitlow as president of the American Society of Addiction Medicine. White socialites snorting cocaine in an Aspen ski lodge are forgiven, while inner-city blacks smoking crack -- just another form of cocaine -- are vilified and locked away, Miller explains. Heroin was romanticized when musicians used it, he says, but after black kids in coastal cities got hold of it, the perception changed and stuck.Now, with the explosion of the opioid epidemic and the emergence of heroin as a less expensive alternative, it's become everybody's problem -- white or black, rich or poor, on the coasts or in middle America, no matter whether you live in a city, suburb or rural community. That's how Lisa got roped in and learned to keep a secret. She admits that the management of her addiction hinges in large part on her husband being by her side. But what if he leaves? What if life tosses her another kind of doozy? How much heroin would she need to ease her pain then? She has no coping skills. She's right at the edge, Gitlow says. What if her dealer gets arrested and her new dealer mixes in fentanyl? Boom. She's dead.  Not everyone I spoke to considers themselves addicts. Enter Matthew. For as long as Matthew can remember, he's battled anxiety and depression. Beyond prescriptions like Xanax or Valium, he began self-medicating at 19 with marijuana and LSD, he says. An arrest for possession of pot and LSD with intent to distribute landed him on probation. Facing regular drug tests that would detect cannabis, he turned to harder drugs that wouldn't stay in his urine as long. That's how Matthew, 28, first tried oxycodone. Later, a doctor would prescribe opioids for chronic stomach pain, a condition he's had for six years. It's the sort of pain, he says, that used to leave him racing to bathrooms so frequently, he couldn't keep a job. Multiple GI doctors have tried to help him. Only prescribed opioids and marijuana have offered relief.Raised in the Eastern US, he now lives in rural Northern California and works as a consultant in the cannabis industry. He doesn't hide his marijuana use or his dependence on pain medications. It's the powdered heroin he purchases on the dark net, the stuff he snorts in the bathroom a few times a day, that he keeps to himself. He says he uses it only when his prescriptions or insurance coverage lapse. He's never used heroin intravenously. Having gone back and forth between pharmaceuticals and illegal supplies, he says he's able to use a milligram scale to carefully measure how much of the powder to take. It's similar to a dose of Percocet. he says. The effect would be like downing a beer or a cocktail. He doesn't use a lot and says he snorts only about $5 of heroin a day. He's stopped in spurts and has written down pro and con lists to see whether he can move on. The pros keep winning out.I just don't find sober me is the best me, he says. Having a secret can be isolating, he says, but otherwise, heroin has not hindered his life. Rather, Matthew says, It's changed my life for the better. Not only does it help with the pain, he says, it constipates him, allowing him to ditch the bathroom and get out of the house.  I'm dependent, he says. But I wouldn't necessarily call myself an addict.  Matthew is kidding himself, experts say.Denial is a crippling component of addictive disease, Gitlow said. Here we have a well-documented illustration of that deadly component. Starting at 19, the signs were there when Matthew turned to drugs rather than conventional coping mechanisms, Gitlow explains. Someone without the addictive disease might have tried those drugs for temporary relief but then realized they weren't worth the long-term risk.Matthew's belief that he doesn't have a problem, Gitlow says, is no different from a man with hypertension or diabetes pretending there's nothing wrong with him.  Plus, using heroin and other opioids changes brain chemistry, says Siobhan Morse, director of clinical services for the Foundations Recovery Network. The natural way a body manages pain or stress, Morse says, is by producing endorphins.If you're giving it the artificial substance, she explains, the brain thinks it doesn't have to make the real thing. So when you take away the artificial substance, everything is so painful. And for people like Matthew who have coexisting mental health issues such as anxiety or depression, self-medication with opioids can make those matters worse, Morse adds. She describes the combination as a moving target.Eventually, she and other experts say, Matthew's drug use will catch up with him.I've never met anyone who's indefinitely held it down being a heroin addict, Morse says. Rebecca has been using for more than three decades -- longer than Matthew, Todd and Lisa combined. She is surprised to still be alive.She grew up in an upper-middle-class household in a tony suburb in the South where she was raised more by the housekeeper than her parents. Her mother was checked out; her father had mistresses and often traveled.I didn't have any boundaries, says Rebecca, 59. I could do whatever I wanted, which was a recipe for disaster.Starting at 12, she tried every narcotic she could find. At 15, the man who was her drug dealer and boyfriend introduced her to heroin. I was in love, she says of the drug. It became the love of my life.One day, she was sleeping on the couch in her family's home when an older sister pinned her down, rolled up one of her sleeves and called out her track marks. Mom didn't bat an eye, Rebecca remembers. Instead, she shrugged it off, saying, Jewish people aren't addicts. Her father, when he was around, was more a friend than a parent. He partied with Rebecca and gave her Quaaludes, she says. Rebecca eventually married the drug dealer-boyfriend, and they had a daughter. But the marriage was short-lived.Divorced and 24, Rebecca went into treatment after her daughter turned 3. Rebecca knew that she was unfit to be a parent and feared she'd lose her daughter forever. It was the first of some 20 times she'd check into a treatment facility for help. Along the way, she re-married; husband No. 2 died of a heroin overdose. Rebecca met her third husband in treatment and stayed sober for eight years. They had two more children and a comfortable lifestyle, enjoying the sort of privileges she knew growing up. But when this marriage fell apart, so did she. That was when I started to spiral down, Rebecca says. As soon as I started using, it was immediate. ... It was like I never stopped using.Even as Rebecca returned to heroin, spending $100 or more a day, she built a career in corporate travel, working for big-name companies.As long as I didn't run out [of heroin] and get sick, I was like Superwoman, she says of her job performance. If I had come in and said I was a heroin addict, people would have laughed. Years of use caught up with her. Lunchtime runs to see her dealer grew longer and became lies about flat tires or broken-down cars. She bounced around between five or six companies, taking extended leaves to go into treatment or try to detox at home. She kept overdosing. A $30,000 mistake at work got her fired.People kept saying, 'You're going to die,'  Rebecca says. The problem with me wasn't that I was going to die, it's that I was going to live. Her kids were mostly raised by other family members and knew her at her worst. They'd see her after overdoses and visit her in the nasty places she called home. It was just awful, says Rebecca, who's still working to repair the relationships she frayed. Today, Rebecca is three years sober. The last time she entered treatment, she says, something clicked, and I remember thinking, 'I can't do this anymore.' She was sick and tired of being sick and tired, she says. I didn't have it in me anymore to keep doing what it took to stay high. Rebecca is not the only member of her family who's struggled. One relative is an alcoholic, another is also a heroin addict, and a third -- who won't touch heroin because of Rebecca -- is hooked on pain pills. It's in the genes, Rebecca says. No doubt.She has seven grandchildren and is determined to be a better grandmother than she was a parent. She lives with a friend in an apartment and works part time for a sober living community. If there's any regret, it's that I've missed decades, Rebecca says. I just thought I wasn't going to live, so I never worried about getting old.  She is fighting to make the rest of her life matter, all the while knowing -- based on decades of experience -- how easily she could slip again. One lapse, one moment of weakness or overconfidence that she can handle it, and everything Rebecca is building up could come crashing down and, quite possibly, bury her."},
{"title": "The infamous murderer's prison escape that inspired a near-impossible ultramarathon", "cate": "health", "content": "Fifty years ago, a career criminal named James Earl Ray traveled from Atlanta to Memphis, stalking the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. The civil rights leader was there to energize a strike of sanitation workers asking for better working conditions and higher pay. Ray was there to assassinate him. While King stood on the balcony of the Lorraine Motel (now a museum for peace), Ray accomplished his sinister goal with a single shot from more than 200 feet away. Over the next two months, while on the FBI's 10 Most Wanted Fugitives List, Ray was on the run, traveling to Europe on a false passport. He was eventually caught at London's Heathrow Airport. He pleaded guilty to avoid a jury trial and the death penalty, was sentenced to 99 years and sent to Brushy Mountain State Penitentiary in eastern Tennessee, surrounded by thick wooded hills. In its day, it was considered one of the toughest state prisons, where inmates frequently killed each other. In the novel The Silence of the Lambs, Dr. Hannibal Lecter negotiates a transfer to the prison.Brushy was also nearly impossible to escape, but Ray managed it with the help of six other convicts in 1977. All were recaptured within days, though rescued is probably the better description. Cold, hunger and disorientation brought them to their knees, and their own fiction-worthy plot turned from The Great Escape to Blair Witch Project. Ray himself traveled only 8 miles in a little over two days, a detail that made one local long-distance runner, Gary Cantrell, think to himself that he could make it 100 miles in that amount of time.And thus the seed of the Barkley Marathons was planted. Cantrell, whose nickname is Lazarus Lake, or Laz as he is known by everyone, was further inspired to start his own race by this rugged land he knew so well. The name brushy is fitting for a rural area thick with undergrowth, briars and hidden obstacles that inflict cuts, bruises and falls. It's so dense, you can't see the top of any of the peaks from the bottom.These mountains, where a day hike can be a challenge, are where truly competitive racing should be held, he thought, not on a flat, paved, well-marked course.The Barkley consists of five loops of 20 miles each (though runners swear it's more like a marathon-length 26 miles). All told, it has about 67,000 feet of elevation -- from sea level to the peak of Mount Everest is 29,000 feet -- not that the other 67,000 feet ofdescent are much easier. The loops are run back to back over three sleepless days and nights, on unmarked trails. Runners must trace the course from a topographical map hours before the race begins. Most other distance races -- with their clear routes, aid stations, teams of helpful volunteers and throngs of encouraging spectators -- are designed so racers finish, but the Barkley is designed so racers fail. And fail they do. Of more than 1,000 who've entered, only 15 have completed the full distance in time. It's a good place for your ego to take a beating, Laz said before this year's race, sporting a red beanie labeled Geezer. His insightful quips are often followed by a cackle of delight, like the Yoda of the runner's world.  Among ultramarathoners, the Barkley is considered one of the hardest -- a superlative that is subjective, of course. There are footraces that cross deserts, traverse tall mountains and even go greater distances than Barkley's 100 or 130 or so miles. But it's the unique combination of impediments, punishing conditions and lack of assistance that makes this race the stuff of legend. It's even the subject of a documentary; a cameraman had to be rescued by rangers more than 12 hours after he got lost.It's only in the face of such opposition that the highest peak physical and mental experiences are achieved. That's the idea, anyway. Among ultramarathoners and elite trail runners, the Barkley is the Holy Grail of races.For a competition that thumbs its nose at conventional rules, this anti-race race does have a number of parameters in which it operates (not written down, of course), all to maximize the challenge. Some of the choice unwritten rules include:Thousands apply every year, and only 40 are chosen. Just figuring out how to apply is a challenge: There's no website, email or physical address posted anywhere. Would-be runners write an essay on why they should be allowed to compete, and Laz chooses among these, factoring in their arguments or, in some cases, poetry but also their proven ability to endure. Finishers tend to have bona fides that include setting speed records on famous long-distance national trails or climbing the highest peaks in the world. If accepted, runners get a letter of condolence and told the date of the race (also a secret), and they must bring a license plate of some variety to the race site that are strung up in walls of metallic memory.This year's lucky (or maybe unlucky) runners -- 31 men, nine women -- gathered on a chilly April evening at a campground at Frozen Head State Park the day before the race. A single copy of the course map sat on a table as runners took turns tracing the route on their own topographical maps. The route changes in parts from year to year, and sometimes a peak is added. Veterans know to laminate them in clear tape to avoid disintegration from the elements. Four or five pages of Laz's enigmatic and wry instructions are also handed out. These mainly help runners find the checkpoint books, which often have tongue-in-cheek titles such as Where Do We Go From Here and A Time to Die. I asked one runner whether I could take a quick look at the instructions, and he seemed wary of handing over such well-kept secrets to a representative of a global media organization. One (non-identifiable) passage read, You will be able to make out the trail that climbs directly to pulloff, unless it is foggy, then you will have to guess.Chicken and beans, cooked over an open fire, were served as part of a potluck the evening before the race started. There is little to noalcohol, as that's not conducive to running 100-plus miles. Runners greet each other warmly and exchange war stories of past Barkleys. It's a rarified club to which they belong. A cake read, Good luck, morons.Because you don't know when the race is going to start, it makes for a fitful night's sleep, lest you miss the sound of the conch. This sleep-depriving FOMO was exacerbated by the cacophony of heavy rain pounding on the tents most of the night.Mercifully, or just randomly, Laz gave everyone a full night of whatever sleep they could get, and the conch was blown at 8:30 a.m., under clear skies. When runners gathered an hour later to start, Laz gave few remarks, none particularly encouraging. After reading the names of Barkley veterans who died over the years, Laz removed his hat, and a bugler played taps, the traditional song of military funerals.Tradition dictates that the start of the race is signaled by Laz lighting a Camel cigarette. Runners started trotting past him as he made his first exhale. The course begins with a steady incline that will reach 1,600 feet of elevation within just the first mile and a half or, as Laz described it, the easiest hill they'll do all day. After that, it turns ugly.Although he's done his fair share of endurance running (including a 318-mile course) and long-distance hiking (he's currently walking from Tennessee to Oregon), Laz has never competed in the Barkley himself. Neither has his friend Barry Barkley, for whom he named the race. The details of the race are a well-guarded secret, and they won't be divulged here. The names of landmarks in the instructions -- Quitter's Road, Rat Jaw -- don't correspond to labels on any official map. The one portion that's not a secret is Brushy Mountain State Penitentiary, which closed for prison business in 2009. Barkley runners jump into a creek and wade through a tunnel that goes under the jail, emerging just steps away from the wall that Ray and his fellow escapees jumped. You can arrange a tour inside the crumbling prison. Ray's cell was No. 27. My guide repeated that the place is haunted without a wink or any indication that she was kidding.The race takes place every spring, a season when weather fluctuates from warm and muggy one hour to freezing and wet the next. Some years, there has been snow to run through and temperatures 10 degrees below freezing. This is the only place you can have 45-mile-per-hour winds and pea soup fog, Laz said, pausing for his punch line: at the same time. This year, it started pleasantly cool and cloudy, but rain and cold punished them as the hours went by.Between each loop, runners will eat, doctor their feet, maybe steal a quick nap. Some rest at base camp as little at 15 minutes, others an hour before being given a new bib number (to get a new page from the checkpoints). The direction of the race changes between loops as well, adding another level of difficulty and more orienteering. In the first four loops, two are clockwise, two counter-clockwise. If more than one runner makes it to the fifth loop, each runner is sent in opposing directions for the final marathon.No one made it past three loops this year. Just over half made it to the second loop, five made it to the third loop, and only one finished the third. As racers dropped out, a bugler played taps. Like some previous years, it was played 40 times. Laz thought two factors that led to the lack of finishers this year were the weather and that he chose fewer Barkley veterans than usual.Finishing is so rare, there is a  on what the experience was like. Brett Maune, 2011's only finisher, calculated 4/5 Pure Joy, 1/5 Pure Hell. Andrew Thompson finished in 2009, after setting the speed record for the 2,160-mile Appalachian Trail in 47\u00bd days. Finishing [the Barkley] was not at all what I expected, he wrote. All the emotion and hoopla and sense of accomplishment with which I had begun Loop 5 were quickly worn down to nubs. The 'victory' lap quickly turned into survival mode. I was sick, and cold, and damn happy to be done.Only one person, Jared Campbell, has finished the race three times. I am thrilled, he said after finishing in 2016, setting a new personal standard for how much adventure I can extract out of $1.60. In 2014, he was more philosophical: There are lessons in life that can only be learned through fairly massive deviations from our normal, comfortable routines. They can sharpen our optimism and generate a deeper appreciation for the simple things in life. And in 2012, he was nearly psychedelic: Due to some extreme foot pain (skin) and sleep deprivation I experienced an incredible distillation of my physical and mental self down to a few basic senses and thoughts, which was both an educational and beautiful experience.In 2013, finisher Nickademus Hollon quoted Plato: The first and greatest victory is to conquer yourself. To reach the Barkley, you will have done massive amounts of trail and endurance running -- even for the annual human sacrifice, as Laz playfully labels one person who he predicts doesn't have the right stuff.But if you're just getting into trail running or adventure racing, you have to put in your vertical hours. Many long-distance runners train in intervals, also known as periodization, building strength by alternating hard and easy weeks of exertion and recovery. Most of the runners in the Barkley run ultra-distances year-round so don't need a training program that starts with short runs.In the case of the Barkley or other unmarked trail races, it is also essential to be able to read a topographical map, something of a dying skill as technology and a lack of wooded adventure rob us of it.Unlike the documentary crew member and King's killer, no Barkley runner has ever got so lost in the area's woods (Laz: 100% self-extraction) that they needed rescuing before they faced starvation or hypothermia. Although GPS devices aren't allowed in the Barkley, plenty of other gear is, including compasses, walking sticks and trail running backpacks with food and water. Many long-distance runners prefer quality, thick-soled shoes; a light but warm jacket for nights and peaks; a hydration pack; portable food; salt tablets; and a powerful headlamp for night running. Unlike other ultramarathons, this one does not have gear requirements. These runners know what they're doing.Training in the sport also includes learning how to avoid injuries, but that's not always possible. Injuries such as cuts and sprains are typical on the Barkley, but nothing has ever halted a runner in their tracks. The worst injury was a kneecap that snapped in two, Laz said, and the runner still finished the loop. It's a different breed, he cackled.Ultrarunners suffer about the as shorter-distance runners, according to a recent study by the University of California, Davis and Stanford University,though some wounds were inflicted by the obstacles of trail running. Among the 1,212 active ultrarunners in the study, injuries were also more prevalent among younger (under age 40), less-experienced runners. Most (64.6%) reported an exercise-related injury that resulted in lost training days over the previous year, but that didn't translate to additional missed days at work. The most common injuries were of the knee and foot stress fractures.That study also found that while ultrarunners tended to be older than the general running population, they had fewer incidents of heart disease and other chronic conditions. They were more likely than the general population to have allergies, hay fever and exercise-induced asthma, probably due to high levels of exposure to pollen-gifting nature. In general, running is outstanding cardio exercise, benefiting much of the body and tied to greater health outcomes than the general population.As for the mental rewards -- well, that's a journey that is as unique as the individual and certainly not guaranteed. A sense of accomplishment is an expression that grossly undersells the thrill of finishing a race as special and difficult at the Barkley. And yet to get to whatever personal heaven awaits you at the finish line, it most certainly means going through hell to get there."},
{"title": "Her only chance at life is a new liver, but her insurer said no. Then she wrote a powerful plea to the CEO", "cate": "health", "content": "All Erika Zak wants to do is play with her daughter on the playground. Take her to the zoo. Walk her to school.She's never been able to be the mother she longs to be.At 38, Erika is dying.Her battle to live began almost as soon as her daughter, Lo\u00efe, was born four years ago, when Erika was diagnosed with stage 4 metastatic colon cancer that had spread to her liver. The cancer was removed from her colon and, her doctors say, she responded well to treatment. But a microwave ablation surgery last year to remove two tumors from her liver went terribly wrong, leaving a fist-sized hole in her liver and destroying her bile ducts. Every day since has been a fight to survive. She's been hospitalized 19 times in Oregon over the last 12 months for infections, bleeding and an array of other health issues.She has high blood pressure in her liver, which backs up the veins in her esophagus and can be catastrophic. Her surgical oncologist constantly worries she will fall ill with a bad infection and die. Every time she calls me and has a fever and some bleeding, we all hold our breath, worried: Will this be the time Erika bleeds to death? says Dr. Skye Mayo, her surgical oncologist at Oregon Health & Science University. This is kind of the end game of what liver failure looks like.More than 100 doctors at three of the nation's top medical centers have weighed in on her case, which is complex and exceedingly rare. Their conclusion: The only way to save Erika's life is to give her a new liver. After weeks of evaluation at the Cleveland Clinic in December and January, Erika finally got her big break. On February 2, doctors there approved putting her on the wait list for a liver transplant. The news changed everything. Erika finally had hope. Around the house, 4-year-old Lo\u00efe would say, Mommy, when you get a new liver, can you push me in the swing?But Erika hit an immediate wall. Her insurer, UnitedHealthcare, denied coverage for the transplant, saying it would not be a promising treatment. She appealed and was rejected again. The mom who desperately wanted to live looked into Oregon's Death with Dignity program. Erika had written a letter to her daughter months ago to be read after she died. Now she worried Lo\u00efe might receive it sooner than Mom had planned: Erika wasn't going to give up. Her little girl with bright blue eyes was a constant reminder of all that is precious. Outraged and heartbroken, Erika wrote a four-page letter to the CEO of UnitedHealth Group, the parent company of UnitedHealthcare (UHC), giving him a piece of her mind about what she felt was a rigged review process, riddled with errors, that determined her life wasn't worth saving.Weeks passed until the company reached a decision. Despite her plea, the answer was the same: Denied. Then, last week, an amazing thing happened. If it's true that opening your heart, revealing your feelings, unleashes freedom and makes you whole, Erika turned to one of the things she loves most in an effort to save her life. Writing. It was early April. She sat at her computer, her keyboard clacking. She wasn't going to leave her husband, Scott Powers, and their daughter Lo\u00efe behind without trying her damnedest to stay on this Earth for as long as possible. There was too much at stake. UnitedHealthcare had overruled her treating physicians and denied the transplant, saying unproven health services is not a covered benefit. The words burned, like chemo. Her first appeal went nowhere, and she felt trapped in a labyrinth of red tape.The young mother -- frail from having lost 20 pounds in the past year, her skin and eyes yellow from jaundice -- felt the only way to get a new liver was to plead her case directly to the CEO of UnitedHealth Group, David Wichmann. Her frame may be tiny, but don't mistake that for weakness. She is one of the strongest women you will ever meet. As she typed, Erika bared her soul. Of longing to live. Of seeing her daughter grow up. Of the need for my only option, a liver transplant.Given that my life hangs in the balance based on this review, she wrote, it is unconscionable that it has not been undertaken with the level of competence and professionalism anyone would expect of UHC.She blasted what she called the shockingly incompetent manner in which the country's largest insurance company handled her case. She outlined what she described as a series of errors made in the review process -- ranging from UHC saying her liver failure stems from chemotherapy toxicity to an insurance medical director who erroneously said she had life-threatening lesions.Neither are true, she wrote Wichmann. (UHC's) handling of my case has been plagued by unnecessary delays, incomplete responses, inept scheduling, contradictory statements, and worst of all repeated factual errors regarding my medical history. Most importantly, decisions based on inaccurate information and analysis have already delayed my listing and transplant two months. One review doctor noted she had a 9cm tumor in her liver, she wrote, apparently unaware that was actually the hole from the ablation surgery resulting in her chronic liver failure. I have been doing every single thing I possibly can do to stay alive for these past four years, scratching and clawing by day and praying every night an opportunity like this would come along, Erika wrote. Now, when the promise of my long-term survival is actually greatest, I need UHC's support more than ever.She sent the letter via FedEx on April 11. Her concerns were valid. Her transplant team at the Cleveland Clinic made clear to UHC's appeals unit the primary cause of her liver failure was not from chemo toxicity or cancer, but instead was the result of a consequence of complications following microwave ablation.  Of note, what mainly drives the indication of liver transplantation in this case is liver failure and NOT liver metastases from colorectal cancer, which makes the patient's post-transplant oncologic outcome more encouraging, wrote Dr. Federico Aucejo, the director of the Cleveland Clinic's Liver Cancer Program, in an appeal on Erika's behalf on March 6. He did note that she had some chemotoxicity, which was a secondary cause of liver failure.The opinion of the experienced Cleveland Clinic multidisciplinary liver transplant committee (is) that liver transplantation would prolong this young patient's life substantially, and that there is NO other treatment alternative that could match this outcome at this point in time.Two days after sending her letter, Erika and her husband were told the UHC executive team had received it and that her case was undergoing further review. Several times, the family said it was told a decision would be made by a certain date; those dates came and went without a decision. As time wore on, Erika grew ill with a high fever and was hospitalized for several days. It was the fifth time she'd been admitted since February 2, the day Cleveland Clinic doctors approved her for a transplant.On Instagram, she posted an illustration with the words waiting, waiting, waiting on a pink backdrop with black crosses. Waiting for insurance to approve the only thing that will save me: a liver, she wrote. Waiting for my liver to fail completely; waiting to die. Waiting to be saved.More than 100,000 Americans are on wait lists for organ transplants, and every hour someone dies while waiting for the life-saving surgery, said Dr. Andrew Cameron, the chief of transplant surgery at Johns Hopkins and the surgical director of its liver transplant program. For liver transplants, 20,000 Americans are on the wait list and only 7,000 will receive a new liver in 2018, according to Cameron, who is not connected to Erika's case. The lucky few undergo a transformative life-saving procedure, he said. Those who don't get that lottery ticket wait or die.Transplant teams at hospitals spend hours upon hours -- months even -- assessing and debating whether a patient is a good candidate for a transplant, Cameron said, typically with more than a dozen doctors weighing in. It is deeply disturbing, he said, when an insurance company overrules the decision made by a thoughtful, careful transplant team to utilize one of society's limited resources -- that precious gift to save somebody's life.The negotiated cost for a liver transplant for an insurance company is roughly $200,000, Cameron said, adding it is exceedingly rare for an insurer to deny a transplant. That is highly unusual and highly undesirable, Cameron told CNN. In Cleveland, Dr. Aucejo is  for patients like Erika, having performed the only two transplants in America this century on people suffering from what is called unresectable metastasis in the liver from colorectal cancer.   It's groundbreaking and could prove transformative. I hope that we can achieve good results and set precedent, he said.  When you're trying such a new approach, Dr. Aucejo said, it can be difficult getting insurers to agree to treatment and he wished getting them aboard could be done in a more expeditious way.He explained that in the late 1980s and 1990s, surgeons tried transplants on patients like Erika with unresectable metastasis in the liver from colorectal cancer, but the outcomes were not good.Only 18% of the patients lived past five years, so the transplants were stopped, Dr. Aucejo said. But, he emphasized, most of the bad outcomes were the result of technical complications and post-transplant management, not from the cancer returning. The field of transplants has greatly improved in the decades since, he said.Doctors in Europe, primarily in Norway, have begun changing the field, he said, finding that about 50-60% of patients with Erika's condition survive a transplant past five years. That is a substantial difference, he said. Dr. Mayo, Erika's surgical oncologist in Oregon, said no one at the insurance company reached out to him during the review process to help explain the facts of her case. That is troubling, he said, especially when it's one of the most complicated cases a doctor will ever see. It is frustrating when it seems that the facts aren't all being considered, Dr. Mayo said. Her life now is not limited by her cancer, he said. It's limited by the fact she will go into liver failure and die within the next several months if she doesn't have a liver transplant.Erika was in the prime of her life. At 34, she'd given birth to her first and only child, Lo\u00efe, the little girl who Mom calls my tiniest, most amazing companion. She'd been married to the love of her life for four years. She and Scott met in 1998 when he was at Brown University and she was at the Rhode Island School of Design, both in Providence. The two were polar opposites. He was the MVP of Brown's soccer team and majored in economics. She was into the arts and majored in textile design. He was from the tightly wound East Coast, she from the free-wheeling West Coast.The connection wasn't immediate, so Erika had a mutual friend slip a tiny drawing to Scott. It contained her phone number; he called it. Soon they clicked. Scott made her laugh and feel beautiful. Erika saw in him someone who was kind and devoted; in her, he found the woman who he'd always searched for, with a captivating sense of humor and a sailor's mouth. They tied the knot on Halloween in 2009 in the wine country of Healdsburg, California.  Her career was taking off, too. She was working for Old Navy, choosing and designing the fabrics, prints and plaids for the company's baby and toddler division. While she was pregnant, she was promoted to senior textile designer.It was all coming together, she wrote on her blog. And then, like that, my foundation crumbled.During the final trimester of her pregnancy, she'd experienced pain in her stomach. It was thought to be nothing more than part of the difficulties of pregnancy. But in the weeks after delivery, the pain grew excruciating and she felt a lump on her side. On April 8, 2014, she received the awful news -- that she had stage 4 metastatic colon cancer that had spread to her liver. Her daughter was just 3 months old. Worst Day Ever read the headline of her blog.She had survived cancer once before. At 28, she was diagnosed with thyroid cancer. Her thyroid was removed, and life continued as normal. It was nothing close to a stage 4 diagnosis. In the years after her colon cancer diagnosis, she blogged about most everything. Of losing her father to Alzheimer's at age 83. Of the pain over two friends' deaths -- including an oncologist she'd met in a cancer support group.Have you ever cried and screamed so hard that the blood vessels around your eyes burst? she wrote. In her blog posts, she was brutally honest about her cancer and the effects of chemotherapy. She'd sit on the shower floor in a fetal position, screaming and sobbing. It was anguish and pain and longing for my former life and utter disbelief for the war my body was waging on itself, she blogged. Her fingertips felt like they had been burned on a hot pan most of the time. Her hands cramped into weird, contorted positions. Her hair was dry and brittle, like straw. Her energy was so drained she felt twice her age.As a teen, she'd suffered debilitating depression and anxiety that was so bad at times, she said, I hoped that I could just disappear forever.It's funny how afraid I am of that now: disappearing. How much I want to live. How important it feels to be here, she wrote on December 1, 2016, two and half years into her cancer battle. She would face multiple surgeries and undergo more than 70 rounds of chemo. On February 28, 2017, she wrote:This is chemo day. Scream in your pillow day. Hide in the shower day. Lie to your baby day. Tell her you're going to work day. Vials and vials of blood day. Tell your doctor you're angry day. Make your husband cry day. Poison your body day. On another day, she penned: Cancer is a slow form of torture. It strips you of dignity; of peace of mind; of stability.On April 4, 2017, nearly three years to the day of her diagnosis, she and her daughter had a soul-crushing conversation. The cancer had been eradicated from her colon shortly after the diagnosis, but it remained in her liver. Mommy, are you going to last? Lo\u00efe asked.What do you mean, Lo\u00efe?Will you be here forever and ever? the girl asked.I really don't know, babe.Six days later, Erika underwent the ablation surgery at a facility in New York to target two small tumors on her liver. Something went wrong. She ended up with the hole in her liver. To save her life, surgeons had to block off the veins and arteries going to her liver. The entire central part of her liver died, Dr. Mayo said. Two bags are now attached to her abdomen to drain the bile. With bile going immediately outside her body, instead of through the liver and her body, Erika was susceptible to extreme sickness and potential fatal bleeds. All of those things culminated in what is now liver failure for her, Dr. Mayo said. She's in this cycle right now where she's losing on a daily basis some of her body's most vital fluids.The cancer in her liver, meanwhile, was progressing on a path, he said, where she would die of cancer. She could no longer tolerate any standard form of chemo treatment. Her doctors in Oregon last fall tried one last treatment to fend off her cancer: a groundbreaking immunotherapy cancer drug called pembrolizumab, known by its brand name Keytruda.Her sky-high tumor marker levels fell to normal. She had an incredible response to this new drug, Dr. Mayo said. I think all of the cancer remaining in her body is dead at this point. What she will die of is liver failure.With a new liver, he said, her problems with bleeding and high blood pressure could be resolved. Her jaundice would be gone, too.But transplant surgery is not without major risks. Most of those who've received a transplant with unresectable metastasis in the liver from colorectal cancer, Cleveland's Dr. Aucejo said, experience a recurrence of cancer within 12 months. Most of the cancers that return can be treated with standard care, like chemotherapy or surgery, he said, profoundly prolonging their lives. For a small subset of patients, though, the cancer comes back aggressively and it's not treatable with chemo or surgery, he said. Unfortunately in that subset of patients, the survival is more dismal.While it's impossible to predict the outcome, he said, Erika shows features that may do well. There's no evidence cancer has spread beyond her liver, he said. Plus, patients who had their colon cancer removed two years or more before the transplant, Dr. Aucejo said, tend do well. Erika had the cancerous portion of her colon removed in 2014: That's a good indicator.Dr. Aucejo also emphasized the criteria for transplant qualification is stringent and that Erika shows promise. We're talking about distributing limited organs, he said. Again, we have to be very careful that we're not giving organs to people who are not going to benefit from it when there's people dying with standard indications because there's not enough organs.In the days and weeks after Erika fired off her letter to the CEO, her husband, Scott, worked the phones. He felt lost in an endless loop of delays and broken promises as to when the insurer would reach its decision. Finally, they were told a decision would come May 2. Erika couldn't sleep the night before. She pulled out her phone and recorded a message, weeping for much of the video. My life is literally in their hands, and every day I feel myself kind of fading away more and more, she says. I don't want to leave. I don't want to die.The next day came. Each minute crept by.Shortly after 2 p.m., Scott's phone rang. It was their point of contact with UnitedHealthcare.He had crushing news: Denied.He explained Erika's case was sent back to the three reviewing doctors. One of them, he said, changed his decision from 'not promising' to 'promising.' However, the other two doctors ruled the transplant not to be promising: The bottom line is they're upholding that decision.The doctor who sided in favor of the transplant, their UHC contact told them, was the only one of the three who talked directly with her transplant surgeon. Scott grew furious. Honestly, you know that is messed up, he said. I don't know who you've got to go to, but I would go to someone now and have someone call us, because this is so messed up.Scott pressed for more information. He got little. Scott, I know what you've been through, the UHC rep told him. I know what you're going through.Erika sat silently for the first 10 minutes of the conservation, absorbing the news and what it meant for her fate. But at those words, it was time to speak up. Hey! she shouted. This is Erika, and you've never heard from me before. You don't know what we're going through. Because I'm dying.Through tears, she said, I need a liver transplant, and I need it now.The UHC rep confided he was not hoping for this outcome. I was hoping that I'd have good news. He suggested Erika and Scott fax over any new information they thought might be relevant. He also acknowledged the delays in recent weeks were not in keeping with the company's policies. Someone needs to be accountable for this, he said. You know, why, when we have these guidelines in place, did we not follow them?That needs to be looked into, he said, adding, I'm not trying to sweep anything under the rug.He apologized for having to be the bearer of bad news, saying his goal had been to end the day on a positive note. Like I said, I wish I had better news. After more than 30 minutes, he ended with: Have a good night, OK. Not the words the couple wanted to hear. Erika went numb. Heartbroken and angry didn't even begin to describe her feelings. Scott felt equally distraught. I just want her to get a liver, he said. She deserves that.The CEO never responded -- not by email, phone or letter.Five days later, on Monday, May 7, a surprise call came. Erika and Scott were preparing Lo\u00efe for school when Scott's phone rang. They had spent the weekend trying to figure out their next move, while trying not to focus too much on when Erika might need Death with Dignity. They knew they had one appeal left, and they didn't want to blow it. They hadn't sent any new information since the last call.It was their UHC rep on the phone. This time, he had good news: The insurer would cover Erika's transplant.When Scott heard she'd been approved, he jumped up and down. Erika watched him from across the room. There was no explanation for the change. They were told to focus on Erika's health and next steps. Erika called her mother, who unleashed a guttural scream at work. Dr. Mayo was preparing for surgery when he took Scott's call. Elation spread across the Knight Cancer Institute at Oregon Health & Science University where doctors, nurses and staff celebrated.In Cleveland, Dr. Aucejo heard the welcome news from his transplant coordinator. He'd not spoken with anyone at UHC about the case in the five days since the previous denial. They had decided on their own. We hadn't gotten back to them, he said. I'm happy they ended up sharing our vision.I had been speaking with Erika and Scott for this story over the last month and had reviewed her medical records extensively. During the May 2 phone call in which Erika was told her transplant had been denied, Scott told the UHC rep that the couple had been speaking with a member of the national news media.I was on a flight to Oregon when they received the joyous news. UHC just called and approved Erika. Unreal. Know you're in flight but call whenever, Scott texted.  When we met a couple hours later, Erika's emotions were still raw. She thought this would be her last Mother's Day. Now, suddenly, she has hope for more. Glancing at her daughter and husband, Erika broke down in tears. I can't imagine not being here, she said. It's not because I keep the family together or anything. It's just the love I have for them.Mommy, why are you crying? Lo\u00efe said.I'm crying because I love you.Lo\u00efe placed her fingers in her mother's right hand. Love you, Lo\u00efe said.As she and Lo\u00efe locked hands, the tattoo on Erika's wrist displayed a fitting message: Be brave.UnitedHealthcare declined to answer CNN's questions about the handling of Erika's case, except to issue this one-sentence statement:We had on-going conversations with her husband and contacted him as soon as the decision was made to approve the transplant request.Even after the approval, Erika said she still wanted to move forward with the story, to speak up for others who've experienced the pain of similar denials. To let them know they're not alone. To encourage them to be their own best advocates.It can mean the difference between life and death. No one should have to fight and work that hard, she said, especially when I have all these doctors saying it will save my life.Since the approval, the family has been preparing to move to Cleveland for Erika's surgery and recovery at the Cleveland Clinic. Erika was officially notified Friday morning she was placed on the liver transplant wait list.It's impossible to know how long the family will be in Cleveland or when the transplant will occur. Transplant candidates are given what is known as a MELD score, ranging from 6 to 40. Those closest to 40 are given the highest priority. Erika's MELD score has hovered around 22. If her score is still in that range, Dr. Aucejo said, her transplant could be a few months away.But this varies a lot, he said. There are many variables at play here.A patient for a liver transplant, he said, is typically hospitalized 7 to 10 days for the procedure, with a recovery time of 4 to 8 weeks before the patient resumes normal activities.Would Erika have had the transplant by now if the surgery had been approved in February?That is very speculative, at the least, Dr. Aucejo said. I couldn't say that.He chose his words carefully, saying it's a complex dynamic between hospitals and insurance companies and he doesn't want to upset that balance. She's been approved and that's what matters -- and hopefully we can move forward with her transplant.Dr. Aucejo said he can somewhat understand the insurance company's initial reluctance at coverage because the procedure is so rare for patients with Erika's condition. It's a new territory, he told CNN. I can't blame anybody.If Erika receives her transplant and succeeds, Dr. Aucejo said, she could help set precedent for many others down the road.More than anything, she would finally get a chance to be the mother she wants to be."},

{"title": "FDA worried drug was risky; now reports of deaths spark concern", "cate": "health", "content": "Two years ago, Brendan Tyne pleaded with the Food and Drug Administration to approve a drug that he was hopeful could finally bring his mother some peace.  She could no longer move without assistance and had fallen victim to the debilitating and frightening psychosis that haunts many people with Parkinson's disease. She thinks there are people in the house and animals are trying to get her, he told an FDA advisory committee. He believed that a new medication called Nuplazid, made by San Diego-based Acadia Pharmaceuticals, was the answer.  Nuplazid's review was being expedited because it had been designated a  -- meaning that it demonstrated substantial improvement in patients with serious or life-threatening diseases compared to treatments already on the market. Congress created this designation in 2012 in an effort to speed up the FDA's approval process, which has long been criticized for being too slow. Around 200 drugs have been granted this designation since its creation.  Still, to recommend approval, the advisory committee would have to find that the drug's potential benefits outweighed its risks for its intended patients. Some FDA officials concluded that Nuplazid's public health benefit was enough to merit approval of the drug. Their argument echoed the pleas of family members and caregivers like Tyne: It could possibly help patients with no other alternative. Several of the people who spoke said their loved ones had been transformed during the clinical trials, though some said there was no way for them to know whether they were on Nuplazid or a placebo.  But the physician who led the FDA's medical review, Dr. Paul Andreason, warned that patients taking the drug during the company's clinical trials experienced serious outcomes, including death, at more than double the rate of those taking the placebo. The company's limited testing, he said, had not convinced him that the benefits outweighed the risks. While Tyne had heard about these risks, he said he discounted death as a real statistical possibility and was willing to try anything to help his mother.  I have two young children who love their grandmother, he told the committee. If nothing is done to bring her back to some semblance of normalcy, my children will never remember their grandmother for who she is: a loving, funny, caring woman who has improved the lives of all of the loved ones who surround her. Please, I beg you, do not deprive my children and their grandmother of experiencing that love. The committee voted 12-2 and recommended that the FDA approve Nuplazid for the treatment of Parkinson's disease psychosis based on a . Three previous studies of the drug did not show that it was effective, Andreason said in his medical review, though they showed similar risk.    Even some committee members who voted in favor of the drug expressed reservations, according to the hearing transcript. I guess I'm hoping that the risks are going to be small, and I think the benefits for some of these people who are very sick and whose families are affected by this, I think they're probably willing to take that risk, one physician stated. Another committee member said she wouldn't have voted for the drug's approval if there had been a safe and effective alternative on the market. A third made a plea to the FDA to consider a large observational study so we can ensure that, once it goes into real-world use, that the benefits will outweigh the risks.   It hit the market in June 2016. As caregivers and family members rushed to get their loved ones on it, sales climbed to roughly $125 million in 2017. Tyne got his mother on the drug as soon as it became available. But after trying it for months, he says he was devastated to see that it was doing nothing to halt the awful progression of the disease, and her hallucinations became more frequent and harder to manage. She has gone straight downhill to the point she really can't function at all, he said.   Shortly after the drug's release, patients' family members, doctors and other health care professionals started reporting adverse events possibly linked to the medication -- including deaths, life-threatening incidents, falls, insomnia, nausea and fatigue. In more than 1,000 reports, patients continued to experience hallucinations while on Nuplazid.In November,  released by a nonprofit health care organization, the Institute for Safe Medication Practices, warned that 244 deaths had been reported to the FDA between the drug's launch and March 2017. The organization also noted that hundreds of reports suggested the drug was not providing the expected benefit or potentially worsening the condition. Tracked by the FDA, these so-called adverse event reports document deaths, side effects and other issues, and can be made directly by consumers, caregivers and other medical professionals. Reports are submitted to either the FDA or to the drugmaker, which is required to pass along any it receives to the federal government. In some cases, the person filing the report is convinced the side effects were caused by the drug; in others, the reporter ascribes no cause but notes that the patient was on the drug. An adverse event report does not mean that a suspected medication has been ruled the cause of harm and is typically not the result of an official investigation. But the FDA uses the information to monitor potential issues with a drug and can take action as needed -- updating a medication's label, for instance, or restricting its use or pulling it off the market.    After analyzing the adverse event data for Nuplazid, the Institute for Safe Medication Practices concluded that this batch of reports reinforces the concerns of those who warned that (Nuplazid) might do more harm than good. Thomas Moore, senior scientist for drug safety and policy for the nonprofit, said the deaths are an important warning signal and warrant further review by the FDA -- and possible action, depending on what the review finds.Since the institute released its analysis,  that the number of reported deaths has risen to more than 700. As of last June, Nuplazid was the only medication listed as suspect in at least 500 of the death reports. Physicians, medical researchers and other experts told CNN that they worried that the drug had been approved too quickly, based on too little evidence that it was safe or effective. And given these mounting reports of deaths, they say that more needs to be done to assess Nuplazid's true risks.This is almost unheard of, to have this many deaths reported, said Diana Zuckerman, founder and president of the nonprofit thinktank the National Center for Health Research, adding that because reports are voluntary, potential problems may be underreported. You just don't see this with most new drugs -- you don't see all these reports -- so you have to take it seriously.Acadia and the FDA maintain that the medication's potential benefits continue to outweigh the risks and help fill a desperate need. Psychosis affects up to 50% of the roughly one million Americans suffering from Parkinson's disease, according to the FDA, and Nuplazid is the first drug to be approved to treat this specific condition.   Acadia said there are a number of reasons for the higher volume of death reports. Parkinson's disease psychosis is more commonly seen in patients in the most advanced stages of the disease, meaning they are already at a high risk of death. Plus, the company distributes Nuplazid through a network of specialty pharmacies that allow them to be in more frequent contact with both patients and caregivers -- meaning it is more likely to receive reports of death, which it is required to pass along to the FDA.If you are actively and regularly engaging patients and/or caregivers, it is inevitable that you will see a higher number of adverse events reported, especially in an older, chronically ill patient population, the company said in a statement.It said its benefit/risk assessment of Nuplazid remains unchanged, and it carefully monitors and regularly analyzes safety reports from both ongoing studies and adverse event reports. The company noted, for example, that since the drug's approval, two studies of a total of more than 300 patients with Alzheimer's disease did not find a difference in the number of deaths reported between Nuplazid and the placebo.  The company also provided CNN with a statement from Dr. Joseph Jankovic, professor of neurology and an expert on movement disorders at Baylor College of Medicine. I have accumulated a great deal of experience with this drug, Jankovic said in the statement. While not all patients are completely satisfied, many of my patients have experienced marked improvement in their visual hallucinations, paranoia and other psychotic symptoms. In an interview this week, FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb was asked by CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta about his thoughts on drugs that receive expedited reviews and then prompt concerns about safety once they become available, like Nuplazid. While Gottlieb didn't want to comment on a specific product, he said he is familiar with the circumstances and that it's very important for the agency to make sure it is appropriately balancing safety with medical need. He said this is a flexible standard, however, and there may be more tolerance for risk in situations where there is a significant need and patients don't have an alternative.  You've seen us take regulatory action recently in the post-market setting to limit the use of drugs when new safety concerns became known, he said.The FDA told CNN it will continue to monitor the adverse event reports and review the drug's safety. It added that Nuplazid's complex safety profile, recognized at the time of its approval, resulted in a requirement that the medication carry a number of warnings on its label so that doctors could analyze potential risks and benefits before prescribing the drug.    The cases reported so far, according to the FDA, typically involved elderly patients with advanced-stage Parkinson's disease who suffer from numerous medical conditions and often take other medications that can increase the risk of death.    Based on these data, the FDA has, at this time, not identified a specific safety issue that is not already adequately described in the product labeling, the agency said in a statement.   The FDA has required antipsychotics to carry its most severe black box warning for the treatment of elderly dementia patients, after studies found that the medications increase the risk of death in this population. Between 50% and 80% of Parkinson's patients experience dementia as the disease worsens, according to the Alzheimer's Association. Because Nuplazid is a new kind of antipsychotic that targets a different receptor in the brain, its maker claims it comes with fewer toxic side effects. Even so, Nuplazid also carries a black box warning.    Geriatric psychiatrist and former FDA medical officer Susan Molchan said that the number of deaths is alarming and questioned whether patients and their families are aware of the risks associated with the drug.    To determine the true risks of Nuplazid, the researchers interviewed by CNN said, the FDA needs to require further scientific studies -- and not just rely on the reports, which are challenging to interpret and are not systematically collected. They also worried that, because the drug was already approved, these studies and any action by the FDA could take years.   A CNN review of several hundred adverse event reports shows that the detail provided for each case varies widely and that thorough investigations are rarely conducted -- making it difficult to determine whether Nuplazid might have been involved in the deaths of already sick and elderly patients.   In these reports, the physicians who prescribed the drug sometimes suggest that their patients likely died from complications from Parkinson's rather than because of Nuplazid. In other cases, it's unclear when exactly the patient started or stopped taking the medication. And in yet others, family members and sometimes doctors are convinced the drug contributed to the deaths.  One report recounts the death of a 73-year-old woman in a long-term care facility who was taking Nuplazid. Just before 8 in the morning, a nurse noted that the woman was sleepy. Shortly after, she was found unresponsive and without a pulse. Paramedics were not able to revive her and, less than an hour after the nurse's visit, she was pronounced dead. While her physician didn't believe her death was related to Nuplazid, her husband was convinced that it had played a role and paid for an autopsy. It showed only that she had pre-existing heart issues and died of cardiac arrest.    In another report, an 89-year-old man was taken off the drug after experiencing a significant decline. His doctor blamed Nuplazid for his deteriorating condition. The patient died weeks later. In a third report, a woman flagged her husband's death to the FDA after he was taken to the hospital due to dehydration. After he passed away, she said, she was told by someone at the hospital that the death was connected to his use of Nuplazid.      Acadia said it analyzed these reports and concluded that there is nothing to suggest a causal relationship to Nuplazid. Acadia calculated a mortality rate for Nuplazid, which it said was lower than what you'd see in the general population of Parkinson's disease psychosis patients covered by Medicare. It calculated this using deaths reported to the FDA and what it considered a conservative estimate of patients on the drug, along with Medicare claims data. However, multiple experts interviewed by CNN said that this is an unreliable calculation since it is comparing apples to oranges.   In the weeks after the Institute for Safe Medication Practices issued its report on the deaths, Acadia's stock price dropped by more than 20%. While many large investors remain bullish about the stock, some investment analysts have made public records requests to the FDA for the death reports.   Currently, Nuplazid can cost nearly $100 a day, according to . That can add up to more than $30,000 a year for a single patient, though the amount a patient actually pays depends on factors including individual insurance coverage.   Acadia expects sales of Nuplazid to at least double this year.    The company, meanwhile, is forging ahead with clinical trials in an attempt to get the medication approved for use in a larger patient population: patients who have dementia-related psychosis. In October, the FDA granted its coveted breakthrough designation for this potential use as well, meaning it will also undergo a speedier review process. While a doctor can legally prescribe a drug for any reason, insurance companies may not approve it for uses that are not FDA-approved. So FDA approval to treat dementia patients would likely result in Nuplazid being prescribed to a much wider population, concerned medical experts told CNN.    You would certainly hope they don't approve it for anything else, said Zuckerman of the National Center for Health Research, based on the current research and FDA adverse event reports. If they're going to approve it for another group of patients that is much, much larger -- that would be unconscionable.    That is something they should absolutely not do given these unanswered questions about risk.    Roughly two years have passed since that FDA meeting, where family members and caregivers -- some of whom traveled there on Acadia's dime -- gathered with medical experts to debate the merits and potential risks of Nuplazid.Andreason, the physician who led the FDA's medical review of Nuplazid, no longer works for the agency. He said that while he stands by the warnings he made at the time, he understands that other antipsychotics used to treat Parkinson's patients also come with an increased risk of death and that, when patients have a debilitating disease like Parkinson's, physicians and caregivers may choose a medication that improves quality of life even if it could also shorten life expectancy.  He said that he was not surprised to hear about the reports of death.   This is exactly what I thought was going to happen, he said. We were going to get a burst of reports of serious adverse events and deaths.  Dr. Stephanie Fox-Rawlings, a senior fellow at the National Center for Health Research who spoke against the drug's approval at the FDA committee meeting, recently told CNN she understands how desperate families in these situations are, but she does not think Nuplazid is the answer based on her review of Acadia's public research. She and Zuckerman said that, after previous studies didn't show it was effective, the drugmaker changed the way the medication's ability to improve psychosis was measured, which resulted in a positive outcome. Acadia said its studies have had different objectives and all of them have used consistent, appropriate, and validated assessment methodology.If patients know there is some level of benefit, they can judge their risk, said Fox-Rawlings. But if we don't even know that it does work, how do you even judge that? It's kind of a false hope.    Kim Witczak was the consumer representative on the FDA committee evaluating Nuplazid. She and the patient representative were the only two members to vote against its approval. She still can't believe it's on the market.  I remember leaving really, really frustrated, she said.    CNN reached two of the three family members who petitioned for Nuplazid's approval at the meeting, despite having had no experience with the drug or its clinical trials, to ask whether they tried the medication once it hit the market.   One of these was Elaine Casavant. Despite the staggering cost of the medication, she said, she was quick to get her husband on it. But after three months, he showed no improvement and they stopped the medication. She has heard success stories, however, and remains optimistic that the drug could be helping certain people.  The other person was Tyne. The 43-year-old New Jersey resident works in New York and visits his mother every weekend at a nursing home in the Bronx. Tyne has attempted to move on from the disappointment of Nuplazid, but he still gets frustrated talking about it.   Knowing what I know now -- that it didn't work at all -- I wouldn't have gotten my hopes up, he said.  But he doesn't regret trying.    If there was something that could possibly help my mom and I didn't do it, I wouldn't be able to look at myself in the mirror. "},
{"title": "Medicine for her diabetes kept her alive -- and it was killing her, too", "cate": "health", "content": "Emmy Reeves shows off the My Little Pony mural she painted in her sister's room. She points out other displays of her work around the family home: a portrait of a cat, a painting of a hillside overlooking Lake Superior, a small sculpture of her riding a wolf. At 13, Emmy has undergone an awakening. Just months ago, she struggled with the rarest of conditions: She was a child with Type 1 diabetes who was allergic to the insulin shots she needed to stay alive. She was given an array of antihistamines to dampen her allergic reactions as a means of survival. But the result was that she slept about 20 hours a day -- and the possibility of dying from her daily insulin remained.The very medicine she needed to stay alive was slowly killing her.It's horrifying to know that every day, you would give your child a medicine that, in essence, could kill them, motherTiffanie Reeves said. It's just really scary.For Emmy, every insulin injection felt like fire spreading through her body, from her fingertips to her toes. When her parents tried to hug her, she'd flinch because the pain was unbearable. The first time she was given an insulin shot, she stopped breathing, fainted and was rushed to the hospital. She was just 4 years old. In the months after, her parents held her down for every insulin shot. She'd scream and shout, I'll be a good girl!We have to do this because we love you. This is what keeps you alive, her parents would say.For nine years, she suffered like this. Beyond the pain, she developed cataracts and often broke out into extreme rashes. She was medicated so much, she struggled with memory and an array of other issues. Her parents tried everything. They took Emmy to top medical institutions and spoke with insulin companies to get the least amount of preservatives in her insulin, because that's what they believed was causing the allergic reactions. Nothing seemed to work.Desperate, her father wrote an email last year to Dr. Raja Kandaswamy, one of the nation's pre-eminent pancreas transplant surgeons. Her quality of life is degrading faster than we had hoped, so now we are looking for a solution that will allow her to stop needing insulin, while we find a solution to her allergy, Jack Reeves wrote.More than 1 million Americans have Type 1 diabetes, an autoimmune condition that destroys the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. Insulin is a hormone needed to allow sugar to enter cells to produce energy. For most children, the condition is managed through insulin injections and a close monitoring of their blood sugar levels. It is exceedingly rare for a child to have an insulin allergy on the magnitude as Emmy.  Emmy's father wasn't looking for a cure for her diabetes.  He was simply hoping to give his daughter an improved quality of life to help manage her diabetes. Her parents feared that she would die within a year if she stayed on the same course of treatment.But that email set in motion a chain of events, resulting in the nation's sole pancreas transplant of a child this young in nearly 25 years. It also led to his daughter being cured of her diabetes. It's amazing. She's a totally different child, her mother said. Every day that she does not reject this organ, I'm going to hug her, even though she may get tired of Mommy hugging her.Kandaswamy, the director of the pancreas transplant program at University of Minnesota Health, remembers receiving the email from Emmy's father like it was yesterday.Kandaswamy, who has two daughters himself, felt the pain of a father who desperately wanted help for his child.  But there was little medical literature to guide or support a pancreatic transplant in a child. There have been other cases in which children receive a new pancreas, but those transplants are usually done in conjunction with kidney and intestine transplants.Only nine children have received a sole pancreas transplant, Kandaswamy said. The last time a pancreas transplant was done  in a child this young, he said, was nearly 25 years ago. That transplant was performed at the University of Minnesota in 1994 on an 11-year-old boy by Kandaswamy's mentor, Dr. David Sutherland, who is considered the father of pancreatic transplants. Unfortunately, that pancreas only lasted six months in the boy.  Pancreas transplants are generally just not done on children, Kandaswamy said. But his mentor taught him to always put a loved one in that patient's place and ask yourself,  'What would you do if it was your mother or your daughter who needed the care?' Ask that question, and you will get your answer.Kandaswamy said that's exactly what he did when Emmy first visited. I have two daughters of my own. One of them is very close in age to Emmy, he said. Looking at her, you could see: 'Hey, if this was your daughter, what would you do?'You couldn't touch her skin without her recoiling, said Kandaswamy, who is also a professor in the department of surgery at the university's medical school. Her quality of life was just deteriorating to the point that this was a cycle that would not be compatible for long-term survival.He had to educate others in the hospital about why he felt the transplant would work for a child. The university had a new pediatric hospital, and if the surgery didn't go as planned, the institution's reputation could be adversely impacted.There was a huge amount of apprehension, Kandaswamy said. I knew we were taking a big risk in that this may not go well.A team of more than a dozen doctors was put together to study Emmy's case: surgeons, anesthesiologists, nephrologists, allergists, transplant coordinators, pain management specialists and others. After a four-day assessment in April 2017 at the University of Minnesota Masonic Children's Hospital, they agreed that a full pancreas transplant was the best option of giving her a better quality of life. We didn't make the decision without due thought and process, Kandaswamy said. We had to do it because of the extenuating circumstances here.Kandaswamy felt that in the nearly 25 years since that first pancreas transplant on a child, the surgical techniques and post-transplant  management have advanced to the point that his team could successfully perform a transplant in a child this young.A healthy pancreas would allow her body to naturally produce insulin -- effectively curing her diabetes -- but the surgery carried many risks, including the possibility her body would reject the organ.Pediatric patients, they have very active immune systems, and they will try to spit out any kind of organ, Kandaswamy said.Emmy and her mother would also need to move to Minnesota from South Carolina to be near the hospital the moment a pancreas became available. Before she headed north, though, Emmy created a bucket list: eat jambalaya in Louisiana, feast on a steak in Texas, visit the Grand Canyon and see her friends from diabetes camp in California, where she once lived. The family hit the road. Emmy got to do everything on her list. It was, her parents say, a farewell trip, should she not survive.Emmy and her mother arrived in Minnesota on July 15. They settled into the Ronald McDonald House, where families stay for free during visits at the hospital. They then had to wait for a pancreas to become available. Three times, the calls came that an organ might be available. Each time turned out to be a false alarm. The second was on Thanksgiving.At one low point, Emmy suffered a severe allergic reaction in January; she stopped breathing and had to be rushed into emergency care. Still, she battled on.Then came the moment. On the afternoon of February 9, Kandaswamy called Emmy's mother with news that a pancreas was available. Emmy was watching a documentary about wolves, her favorite animal, with her tutor at a museum. Mom let her finish watching the film and then told her it was time. They needed to rush back, gather up some belongings and get to the hospital. When they got to the Ronald McDonald House, the place was abuzz. Word had spread like wildfire that Emmy's moment had arrived. Families and staff cheered them on and wished them well. At the hospital, Kandaswamy greeted them in the lobby. He explained that a procurement team had gone to get the organ about an hour away in St. Cloud -- that there was still a possibility it might not be a proper fit but that he was optimistic. Emmy was prepped for the surgery so she would be ready when the pancreas arrived. About 3 a.m., Kandaswamy conferenced in Jack, who was back in South Carolina with Emmy's younger sister. I think we are going to go ahead. The organ looks good, he said. On Emmy's 210th day in Minnesota, the transplant began. That number isn't lost on the family: She was wheeled into the operating room on 2/10.As Emmy underwent surgery, Mom clutched a tattered yellow stuffed animal named Ducky, who was given to Emmy after she was diagnosed with diabetes. The surgery took more than four hours. It was a great, great feeling when we got her done, Kandaswamy said. But I knew in my mind that the job was only half done. We were excited but also cautiously optimistic at that point.The doctors had to make sure the new pancreas -- what Emmy nicknamed Player 2 -- worked properly, that her body didn't reject it and that her body could tolerate the immunosuppressive drugs she needed after the transplant.She responded well the first week, but in the second week after the transplant, her body began to reject the organ. Her immune system saw it as foreign and tried to attack it.I had to come and tell her that her body is in rejection, her mother said. We're not sure what's going to happen in the future.They decided to try a stronger immunosuppressant. We're already down the rabbit hole, Mom. We gotta do what we gotta do, Emmy said.Ever since, her pancreas has functioned as hoped.Dr. Melina Bellin, the pediatric endocrinologist with University of Minnesota Health who worked with Emmy, said it was touch-and-go early on, but everyone was relieved when Emmy's health turned around.It's particularly rewarding when you're at that point in the beginning when you're not 100% sure it's going to turn out the way you wanted, she said. It definitely makes it that much better when it does.Kandaswamy added, We were able to treat it effectively and got it turned around.With the healthy new pancreas, he said, her diabetes has been cured. She no longer needs insulin shots or the antihistamines that she was taking to try to limit her allergic reactions. The hospital slowly weaned her off all of those medications that were making her extremely drowsy and blunting her consciousness, Kandaswamy said. Then we saw the real Emmy. She started really blossoming, he said. It's like a cloud has been lifted off her consciousness so she can actually express all of this stuff in a big way.One of the greatest moments of his career, Kandaswamy said, was when Emmy hugged him: There was nothing more fulfilling than seeing her walk up, give me a hug and say, 'I want to go back home.' It's the greatest thing I've ever heard.Pancreas transplants are not recommended for most children with diabetes, but Kandaswamy said he hopes this case will open the way for children with rare conditions like Emmy who could benefit from a pancreas transplant. I think this will be an index case that will help spark that awareness, he said.In the family home in Columbia, South Carolina, Jack and Tiffanie Reeves are still in near disbelief at how well Emmy is doing. She's thriving in ways they could only dream of. Beyond her artwork, she's started playing the piano. She can go on hikes. She can shoot hoops. She can play with her younger sister, Abby. She's getting a childhood, finally. She's getting to be able to be a kid, her mother said. I mean, this child's achieved so much in just the three months since transplant. It's going to be pretty incredible to get to see what she'll be able to do in the next few years.The family agreed to tell Emmy's story in hopes that it can help other children suffering as she did. They know of four young children around the world with a similar insulin allergy as she. If our experience could help even one kid, I think it would be worth it, Tiffanie said.Emmy is not out of the woods. The first year after a transplant is especially critical. Her body could still reject the organ. The family tries not to dwell on that. We still live life, and we don't let the worry and stress of that keep us and our daughters from living the life that we need to, her father said. Emmy hopes to be a zoologist one day. For now, she's shy around CNN's camera and doesn't want to talk with cameras rolling. When they're off, she stands next to a window overlooking her backyard and a decaying swing set.She says she's drawn sketches of what she envisions back there: a greenhouse, a new swing set, a fire pit and a fence. When the Make-A-Wish Foundation reached out, she told them she didn't want to travel anywhere fancy or meet a famous star. Instead, she shared her vision of a new backyard, a place where she can finally be herself."},
{"title": "The Kentucky county where the water smells like diesel", "cate": "health", "content": "For the past 20 years, Hope Workman has hustled up a dirt path on the side of a mountain in Lovely, Kentucky,just to get drinking water. She doesn't trust what comes out of her tap. If she's by herself, she'll take her ATV. If one of her daughters is coming along, they take their four-wheel-drive truck. It takes her about seven minutes to grind up the hill before she reaches her destination: a small plastic well tapped into the side of the mountain with a 3\u00bd-foot PVC pipe. The day CNN visited, the temperature was just above freezing, and Hope's hands shivered as she filled jug after jug with crystal-clear drinking water. This is what we go through to get water, unfortunately, she said. Workman is not the only person in Martin County, Kentucky, or America for that matter, who struggles to get clean water. Two well-publicized crises include Flint, Michigan's, lead contamination and Puerto Rico's failing water systems in the wake of Hurricane Maria. As our water infrastructure system ages, experts say, keeping America's water clean becomes increasingly challenging. The  gives the nation's drinking water infrastructure a grade of D.According to the the society, about  of pipes crisscross the country to deliver us clean water, much of it overseen by local municipalities that are challenged with aging hardware. Many of these pipes were laid underground nearly a century ago and are reaching the end of their life spans. As they age, they can crack, and water breaks become more common. In fact, the entire country loses nearly 6 billion gallons of water a day just to leaky pipes. For many cash-strapped local utilities, it's difficult to find the resources to manage a problem we rarely see. But when the problem does come to the surface, it's hard to ignore. Just ask the residents of Martin County. Customers of the county's water district post videos and pictures on social media of brown cloudy water spouting out of their taps. Sometimes, it comes out looking like blue Gatorade. Sometimes, it smells like diesel fuel. Locals ask themselves, Just what's in the water?Until several months ago, customers received notices on the back of their water bills stating that their water had been tested and found to be above federal limits of . These contaminants are a reaction between the chlorine used to treat the water for bacteria and organic matter that may be found in the water or the pipes. Exposure to these chemicals could mean an increased risk of cancer. Eastern Kentucky has some of the highest levels of cancer in the country due to smoking and obesity, but residents here also wonder whether their water is to blame. Martin County resident BarbiAnn Maynard is convinced that her mother's cancer was related to the water. We don't really know what to do. We're just scared of the water and have been for years, she said. You're afraid to wash your hands if you've got a cut, Maynard said. Taking a shower is no better. I don't feel like I'm getting clean. I might smell a little bit better, but I don't feel any better about it. Dr. Don Lafferty, a local physician, feels that he's in a difficult position when patients ask him whether the water is the source of their health issues. I can't tell them it's safe or it isn't safe, he told CNN's chief medical correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta. We shouldn't have to be asking ... in 2018 whether or not water is causing cancer in our region. Nestled in the hills of Eastern Kentucky, Martin County has had a long history tied to coal. Between 1918 and 2015, the county produced more than 436 million tons of coal.But as the coal industry died out, Martin County struggled. Nearly 40% of its population lives at or below the federal poverty level. The unemployment rate in the county is almost double the national rate. But poverty hasbeen endemic to the area for years. President Lyndon Johnson came here in 1964 to launch his War on Poverty. In 2018, in the very place where LBJ declared war on poverty ... water is our number one issue. That's hard to imagine, said Gary Ball, editor-in-chief of the local weekly newspaper, The Mountain Citizen. What's happened in Martin County is a worst-case scenario that may be happening in other parts of the country, said Lindell Ormsbee, director of the Kentucky Water Resources Research Institute at the University of Kentucky.  I think it's somewhat of a systematic representation of what's happening in a lot of other placeswhere no one's looking. It's almost like the proverbial canary in the mine, Ormsbee said. A large part of the issue in Martin County is just hardware itself. There are about 300 miles of piping that deliver water across the county, placed up and over rocky terrain, making them even more susceptible to leaking. Today, more than half of the water that leaves the Martin County Water District treatment center doesn't make it to the faucet. When water systems are operating optimally, there is enough going through the pipes at a high enough pressure that debris from outside the pipe can't make its way inside. Essentially, there's so much water going through so quickly that even if there is a crack in the pipe, the water can act as a barrier. But as soon as that pressure drops or there's less water going through the pipes, there is suddenly room for soil, debris and chemical residue to sneak into the drinking water. And because of the leakage issues, the Water District hasn't been able to flush the water lines clean in years, said Joe Burns of the Kentucky Rural Water Association. As far as systematic lines, it's been years since it's even been able to be accomplished. Burns' group is working with the Martin County Water District to help make improvements as best as they can. They've been able to reduce the levels of byproduct contaminants to under federal limits by simply changing where they add the chlorine. But on top of issues with the lines, there are upgrades to the water treatment facilities, pumps and meters that stillneed to be made. For a financially struggling municipality, it is hard to find resources outside raising water rates, which is difficult for a community of people who mostly live on a limited income. Infrastructure isn't just pipes and hardware, Ormsbee said; it also includes financial and technical management. Small water systems, such as Martin County, that serve less than 10,000 customers supply water to nearly . In addition to  infrastructure and financial challenges, many of these systems can have a difficult time attracting the technical expertise to help. In fact, small systems made upof EPA violations in 2015 and 2016. Some citizens in Martin County feel that they've been forgotten. Appalachia has been at the forefront in helping to improve this country for many years. ... We've sent people to die in all of our country's wars. We've populated this country with people in all industries, Lafferty said. We are Americans, too.Ball points to a new government center and a business complex in Inez, the county seat. The cost is nearly $20 million, money that he said could have been spent on upgrading the water system.  Recently, Martin County received federal grants amounting to $3.4 million to go toward its water system. Experts believe that overhauling the system would take $13.5 million to $15 million. President Trump's infrastructure proposal gives some residents hope. The $1.5 trillion plan touted by the White House is supposed to coverall infrastructure upgrades in the nation, but experts believe that it would cost the country $1 trillion just to maintain and meet the demands for drinking water for the next 25 years. Critics further point out the White House's plan earmarks only $200 billionin federal investment. The remainder is to be made up by the states and the private sector. Time will tell, Lafferty said. Politicians should remember that 'forgotten people' usually have long memories.  An earlier version of this story gave the incorrect year of President Johnson's visit to the county."},
{"title": "CNN Exclusive: Bayer paid doctors millions for questionable birth control device", "cate": "health", "content": "When Christina Potts was looking for permanent birth control, she said, her doctor was a cheerleader for one option and one option only: Essure.Potts says the device, which is implanted in a woman's fallopian tubes to block sperm from reaching an egg, left her in terrible pain and extremely fatigued.It was so bad that she had a hysterectomy, removing her uterus and tubes to get rid of Essure.Last week, the US Food and Drug Administration expressed safety concerns about Essure, and Bayer Pharmaceuticals announced that it would pull the device off the market at the end of the year.Potts says she'll always wonder this: Did her former gynecologist recommend Essure because it was best for her or because Bayer paid the doctor tens of thousands of dollars?A CNN analysis of federal data, shows that from August 2013 through December 2017, Bayer paid 11,850 doctors $2.5 million related to Essure for consulting fees and similar services.These payments are legal but very controversial.Potts' doctor was one of the highest earners, according to federal data. Dr. Cindy Basinski was paid $168,068 for consulting fees and similar services from August 2013 through the end of 2017.More than 80% of the money that Bayer paid to Indiana doctors for Essure was paid to her. Nationally, she was the second highest-paid doctor for the service, one of just three doctors to earn more than $100,000.The financial information comes from a federal database that covers August 2013 through the end of last year. Basinski said she also received payments related to Essure for about five years before that, but the database doesn't go back that far, and Basinski says she doesn't remember what she was paid during those years.I will tell you that my best guess is that early on it was very minimal, $5,000 to $7,000 a year, she said.Basinski says she's so convinced of Essure's safety that she'll continue to implant it into women until the device comes off the market.Studies by scientists at the , ,  and , among others, show that when doctors are paid by pharmaceutical companies, they're more likely to prescribe drugs made by those companies.In those studies, the payments are typically much more modest than what Basinski has received. But the gynecologist said her clinical judgment hasn't been swayed by the money.I will say that I do not feel that it influenced me at all in any way, she said.She said she could have earned the same amount if she'd been seeing patients during the hours she was paid by Bayer to educate doctors about the device and how to implant it.I think that there can be professional relationships with companies and physicians. I did a lot of work to earn that money, she said. A majority of activities were involved with educating physicians.She added that she's turned down money -- in some cases more than Bayer paid her -- because she did not believe in a certain product.Bayer announced last week that declining sales is the reason it will and that it stands by the safety of its product.But according to a  put out the same day, the device has been associated with serious risks including persistent pain, perforation of the uterus and fallopian tubes, and migration of the coils into the pelvis or abdomen.Bayer's announcement came just days before Netflix premiered a documentary about the dangers of Essure and other medical devices, On Friday, Bayer posted a to the documentary, which states that the film presents an inaccurate and misleading picture of Essure.Also Friday, the pharmaceutical company published an  which states that the company's decision to stop selling Essure was not based on concerns about the safety and efficacy of Essure. Essure has been on the market for more than 15 years and has been successfully used by hundreds of thousands of women.The Netflix documentary features a group of women who lobbied Congress for years to get Essure off the market.Their private Facebook group, Essure Problems, has more than 37,000 members, including more than 12,000 women who say they've had a hysterectomy or other surgical procedure to remove the device, according to group founder Angie Firmalino.When Potts, who teaches children with special needs in Petersburg, Indiana, gave birth to twins Eli and Brena in 2006, she and her husband knew that they wanted permanent birth control. With four children -- they have an older daughter and son -- their family was complete.Potts, then 27, asked Basinski about getting her fallopian tubes tied, but she says Basinski told her that wasn't a good choice for a woman with four young children, because it involved recovery time from the surgery. Essure could be implanted vaginally right in the office, in a procedure much like a routine Pap smear.She was very upbeat about it, Potts said. I felt like she was very pushy.She and other patients who saw Basinski told CNN that the doctor seemed like a cheerleader for Essure. Potts said that's why she didn't call Basinski when she developed headaches, joint pain, abdominal cramping and extreme fatigue about a year after she got the implant.She said she felt so sick that she had to rely on her oldest child, then 8, to help with her three younger children.It was hard, she said.Since the hysterectomy, her symptoms have almost completely gone away, she said.Potts says she's angry that, in her memory, Basinski dismissed having her tubes tied, also known as tubal ligation, the other option for permanent female birth control.She felt violated because she felt that her choice was taken away.I felt like it was Dr. Basinski's decision, more or less, because she said that this was best, and I wasn't really given another option, she said.Basinski said she couldn't recall her conversation with Potts, but said she felt Potts was not remembering the conversation correctly. She said she routinely gives patients options for sterilization procedures.In my notes I did document that I talked about risks, benefits, and alternatives with her, Basinski said.Another patient said Basinski also dismissed tubal ligation as an option in favor of Essure. That patient, who requested not to be named to protect her privacy, later went to a different doctor to have a hysterectomy to remove the device.Basinski says that if it seems to her patients that she stresses Essure, that's only because it's a relatively new device -- it was approved by the FDA in 2002 -- and so it requires more explanation.We go through all of the options and all of the risks and benefits, she said. It is my obligation to offer patients all available products on the marketplace, explain the risks and benefits and why they may want to choose one or the other.But Potts and other patients say Basinski's marketing puts that claim into question. She's had YouTube videos, a website and a highway billboard all devoted to Essure.In 2009, she appeared on The Balancing Act, a television show aimed at women, along with Trista Sutter, a former Bachelorette contestant who had been implanted with the device.The host asked about the popularity and risks of Essure.Well, I'm going to tell you something, because of Miss Trista here, I think we're going to have women flocking to the doctor's office to get Essure, Basinski said. When women find out about this, they want this procedure.CNN spoke to two of her former patients who were pleased with Essure. Knowing Dr. Basinski, I don't believe that she would ever be biased in leading a patient towards something that she didn't feel was appropriate for them, said Cindy Dossett, who was implanted with Essure in 2008. I have always trusted her judgment. She has never given me any reason not to, and I wouldn't say that about all doctors.In a statement to CNN, Bayer said that close cooperation with, and continuous education of, healthcare professionals is key to achieving better outcomes for the patients we strive to help.The statement added that health care professionals are compensated for their expertise and the services they provide to the pharmaceutical industry. It is appropriate and ethical for Bayer to compensate medical professionals for the time they spend on these activities.Friday Bayer provided CNN a document outlining the company's procedures for Essure related payments to outside medical experts.   These agreements between Bayer and its consulting physicians do not compensate them for the use of Essure, it states. They are not being paid by Bayer to purchase, prescribe, or otherwise support Essure.Dr. Martin Makary, a professor of surgery and patient safety expert at Johns Hopkins Medicine, said that although it's ethical for a pharmaceutical company to pay a doctor for genuine research, he doubted that the more than 11,000 doctors paid by Bayer were involved in such efforts.That looks like a bribe, he said. That looks like gaming the system. That looks like the pharma company is paying off doctors.The FDA estimates that Essure has been used by  since it was approved on November 4, 2002. At the time, Essure was manufactured and marketed by Conceptus Inc., which Bayer acquired in June 2013. From 2002 through 2017, the patient problems most frequently  to the FDA were pain/abdominal pain (21,215), heavier menses/menstrual irregularities (9,846), headache (7,231), fatigue (5,842) and weight fluctuations (4,970).According to the , reported adverse events cannot be interpreted or used in isolation to reach conclusions about the existence, severity or frequency of problems associated with devices and confirming whether a device actually caused a specific event can be difficult based solely on information provided in a given report.In April, the FDA restricted sales of Essure to only doctors who give patients FDA-approved patient education materials that describe the risks.Basinski says she wishes women could keep getting Essure beyond the end of this year.I think it is a safe and viable option for women, and I'm very sad that it's not available in the marketplace after December of 2018 for women [for whom] this may be the right option, she said.This story has been updated with additional comments from Bayer and added detail on the adverse event reporting process for medical devices."},
{"title": "CNN Exclusive: The more opioids doctors prescribe, the more money they make", "cate": "health", "content": "As tens of thousands of Americans die from prescription opioid overdoses each year, an exclusive analysis by CNN and researchers at Harvard University found that opioid manufacturers are paying physicians huge sums of money -- and the more opioids a doctor prescribes, the more money he or she makes.  In 2014 and 2015, opioid manufacturers paid hundreds of doctors across the countrysix-figure sums for speaking, consulting and other services. Thousands of other doctors were paid over $25,000 during that time.Physicians who prescribed particularly large amounts of the drugs were the most likely to get paid. This is the first time we've seen this, and it's really important, said Dr. Andrew Kolodny, a senior scientist at the Institute for Behavioral Health at the Heller School for Social Policy and Management at Brandeis University, where he is co-director of the Opioid Policy Research Collaborative. It smells like doctors being bribed to sell narcotics, and that's very disturbing, said Kolodny, who is also the executive director of Physicians for Responsible Opioid Prescribing. The Harvard researchers said it's not clear whether the payments encourage doctors to prescribe a company's drug or whether pharmaceutical companies seek out and reward doctors who are already high prescribers. I don't know if the money is causing the prescribing or the prescribing led to the money, but in either case, it's potentially a vicious cycle. It's cementing the idea for these physicians that prescribing this many opioids is creating value, said Dr. Michael Barnett, assistant professor of health policy and management at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. CNN spoke with two women who've struggled with opioidaddiction, and they described the sense of betrayal they felt when they learned that their doctors had received large sums of money from the manufacturers of the drugs that had created such havoc in their lives. Carey Ballou said she trusted her doctor and figured that if he was prescribing opioids, it must be because they were the best option for her pain. Then she learned that opioid manufacturers paid her doctor more than a million dollars over two years. Once I found out he was being paid, I thought, 'was it really in my best interest, or was it in his best interest?'  she said. To do the analysis, CNN -- along with Barnett and Harvard's Dr. Anupam Jena -- examined two federal government databases. One tracks payments by drug companies to doctors, and the other tracks prescriptions that doctors write to Medicare recipients. The CNN/Harvard analysis looked at 2014 and 2015, during which time more than 811,000 doctors wrote prescriptions to Medicare patients. Of those, nearly half wrote at least one prescription for opioids.  Fifty-four percent of those doctors -- more than 200,000 physicians -- received a payment from pharmaceutical companies that make opioids.Doctors were more likely to get paid by drug companies if they prescribed a lot of opioids -- and they were more likely to get paid a lot of money. Among doctors in the top 25th percentile of opioid prescribers by volume, 72% received payments. Among those in the top fifth percentile, 84% received payments. Among the very biggest prescribers -- those in the top 10th of 1% -- 95% received payments.On average, doctors whose opioid prescription volume ranked among the top 5% nationally received twice as much money from the opioid manufacturers, compared with doctors whose prescription volume was in the median. Doctors in the top 1% of opioid prescribers received on average four times as much money as the typical doctor. Doctors in the top 10th of 1%, on average, received nine times more money than the typical doctor. The correlation you found is very powerful, said David Rothman, director of the Center on Medicine as a Profession at the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons. What's amazing about the findings is not simply that money counts but that more money counts even more. Paying doctors for speaking, consulting and other services is legal. It's defended as a way for experts in their fields to share important experience and information about medications, but it has long been a controversial practice.\u202f\u202f Pharmaceutical company payments to doctors are not unique to opioids. Drug companies pay doctors billions of dollars for various services. In 2015, 48% of physicians .  It's illegal, however, for from a manufacturer.  Dr. Steven Stanos, president of the American Academy of Pain Medicine, said he wasn't surprised that doctors who frequently prescribe a drug are often chosen and paid to give speeches about the drug to other doctors.  They know those medicines, and so they're going to be more likely to prescribe those because they have a better understanding, Stanos said, adding that some of the money paid to doctors may have been to teach other doctors about new abuse-deterrent opioid drugs.  Stanos' group accepted nearly $1.2 million from five of the largest opioid manufacturers in the United States between 2012 and 2017, by the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.  Stanos said the money was used for various projects, including courses on safe opioid prescribing.  I would obviously hope that a physician would not prescribe based on some type of kickback or anything like that, that they'd obviously be prescribing [in] the best interest of the patient, he said. But Dr. Daniel Carlat, former director of the Prescription Project at the Pew Charitable Trusts, said the CNN and Harvard findings are in line with other studies suggesting that money from drug companies does influence a doctor's prescribing habits. It's not proof positive, but it's another very significant data point in the growing evidence base that marketing payments from drug companies are not good for medicine and not good for patient care, said Carlat, a psychiatrist who blogs about conflicts of interest. It makes me extremely concerned. Barnett, one of the Harvard researchers who worked with CNN, said pharmaceutical companies pay doctors for a reason.  It's not like they're spending this money and just letting it go out into the ether, he said. They wouldn't be spending this money if it weren't effective.  According to a statement by the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, drug companies support mandatory and ongoing training for prescribers on the appropriate treatment of pain.  PhRMA supports a number of policies to ensure patients' legitimate medical needs are met, while establishing safeguards that prevent overprescribing, according to the statement from the group. Angela Cantone says she wishes she had known that opioid manufacturers were paying her doctor hundreds of thousands of dollars; it might have prompted her to question his judgment. She says Dr. Aathirayen Thiyagarajah, a pain specialist in Greenville, South Carolina, prescribed her an opioid called Subsys for abdominal pain from Crohn's disease for nearly 2\u00bd years, from March 2013 through July 2015.  Subsys is an ultrapowerful form of fentanyl, which is 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine, according to the . He said it would do wonders for me, and it was really simple and easy. You just spray it in your mouth, Cantone said. She says Subsys helped her pain, but it left her in a zombie-like state. She couldn't be left alone with her three young children, two of whom have autism and other special needs.  I blacked out all the time. I'd find myself on the kitchen floor or the front lawn, she said. She says that if she missed even one day of the drug, she had uncontrollable diarrhea and vomiting.  She said she brought her concerns to Thiyagarajah, but he assured her it couldn't be the Subsys that was causing her health problems.  I trusted him. I trusted my doctor as you trust the police officer that's directing traffic when the light is out, she said.  She says that when she eventually asked Thiyagarajah to switch her to a non-opioid medication, he became belligerent. He said it was Subsys or nothing, she said. Cantone would later learn that from August 2013 through December 2016, the company that makes Subsys paid Thiyagarajah more than $200,000, according to , the federal government database that tracks payments from pharmaceutical companies to doctors. CNN compared the $190,000 he received from 2014 to 2015 with other prescribers nationwide in the same medical specialty and found that he received magnitudes more than the average for his peers.Nearly all of the payments were for fees for speaking, training, education and consulting. Cantone is now suing Thiyagarajah, accusing him of setting out to defraud and deceive her for the sole purpose of increasing prescriptions, sales, and consumption of Subsys to increase ... profits. Through his attorney, Thiyagarajah denied any wrongdoing but declined to comment on this story due to the pending litigation. In a court filing responding to Cantone's lawsuit, Thiyagarajah denied all of the allegations against him and said that all medical care provided to Cantone was reasonable and appropriate and in keeping with the standard of care. His attorney, E. Brown Parkinson, said the doctor is currently practicing medicine, alternating weeks between his practices in South Carolina and New York. Thiyagarajah might be expected to write a relatively high number of prescriptions for opioid painkillers, given that he's  in physical medicine and rehabilitation with a subspecialty in pain medicine.  But he wrote an unusually high number of prescriptions for Subsys and other opioids even when compared with other doctors with the same certifications.  In 2014 and 2015, physicians with Thiyagarajah's certifications wrote an average of 3.7 opioid prescriptions per Medicare patient per year, according to the analysis by CNN and Harvard. Thiyagarajah, however, annually wrote more than seven opioid prescriptions per patient per year.After about two years on Subsys, Cantone says, she took herself off the drug cold turkey. According to an affidavit by an investigator for the Drug Enforcement Administration, Thiyagarajah's office was inspected by the agency in June 2015 and found to be prescribing another opioid, buprenorphine, for non-legitimate medical need in violation of federal law. In March 2016, the agent conducted another inspection and seized 45 medical records related to Subsys. The DEA did a compliance review and referred its findings to the Department of Health and Human Services, according to Robert Murphy, associate special agent in charge of the agency's Atlanta Field Division.  Cantone is also suing Insys, the company that makes Subsys. Insys denied allegations of wrongdoing in a court filing responding to Cantone's lawsuit.  Separate from Cantone's lawsuit, John Kapoor, the founder and largest shareholder of Insys, was  and arraigned in federal court in October on charges of bribing doctors to overprescribe the drug. Dr. Kapoor engaged in no wrongdoing and refutes all of the charges in the strongest possible terms, said Tom Becker, a spokesman for Kapoor. He looks forward to being fully vindicated after having his day in court.  Kapoor resigned from the Insys board of directors in October, according to a company .  Several other Insys executives were  with an alleged racketeering scheme.  Separately, Sen. Claire McCaskill, a Democrat from Missouri, is conducting an investigation into the opioid industry. According to her investigation and the federal indictment, Insys used a combination of , such as falsifying medical records, misleading insurance companies and providing kickbacks to doctors in league with the company.  Saeed Motahari, president and CEO of Insys, wrote a  in September to McCaskill, noting that he was concerned about certain mistakes and unacceptable actions of former Insys employees. He added that most of the field-based sales staff were no longer with the company.  I stand with you and share the desire to address the serious national challenge related to the misuse and abuse of opioids that has led to addiction and unnecessary deaths and has caused so much pain to families and communities around the country, Motahari added.  Sometimes, pharmaceutical companies pay doctors to do medical research. They also pay doctors for promotional work: for example, to speak with other doctors about the benefits of a drug.  Among the doctors who prescribe the highest volume of opioids, the CNN/Harvard analysis found that the largest amount of money was paid for that second category, which includes speaking fees, consulting, travel and food. Concerns about payments to doctors by opioid manufacturers were brought to light last year in a  by researchers at Boston University.  Several studies published in medical journals in recent years have found an association between payments by pharmaceutical companies for various types of drugs and doctors' prescribing habits. For example, researchers at the  examined the two government databases analyzed by CNN and Harvard and found that when doctors received payments from manufacturers of certain cancer drugs, they were more likely to prescribe those drugs to their patients. This study suggests that conflicts of interest with the pharmaceutical industry may influence oncologists in high-stakes treatment decisions for patients with cancer, the authors concluded. Some studies have looked at whether the amount of money a doctor receives makes a difference. Studies by researchers at , the  and  have all found that the more money physicians are paid by pharmaceutical companies, the more likely they are to prescribe certain drugs. Dr. Patrice Harris, a spokeswoman for the American Medical Association, said that the CNN and Harvard data raised fair questions but that such analyses show only an association between payments and prescribing habits and don't prove that one causes the other. It's not a cause and effect relationship, said Harris, chairwoman of the association's opioid task force, adding that more research should be done on the relationship between payments and prescriptions. [We] strongly oppose inappropriate, unethical interactions between physicians and industry, she added. But we know that not all interactions are unethical or inappropriate. \u202f Harris added that relationships between doctors and industry are ethical and appropriate if they can help drive innovation in patient care and provide significant resources for professional medical education that ultimately benefits patients.  Stanos, the pain physician, said a doctor who gets paid by a pharmaceutical company and prescribes that company's drug might truly and legitimately believe that the drug is the best option for the patient. I hope physicians that do promotional talks prescribe because they think the medicine has a benefit, he said. But Jena, one of the two Harvard researchers who collaborated on the CNN analysis, said he worries that money from opioid manufacturers -- especially large amounts of money -- could influence a doctor to prescribe opioids over less dangerous options.  Every decision, every recommendation a physician makes, should be in the best interest of the patient and not a combination of the patient's interest and the financial interest of the doctor, said Jena, associate professor of health care policy at Harvard Medical School.  If we lived in a different world where none of these payments to physicians occurred,  how many fewer Americans would have [been prescribed] opioids, and how many fewer deaths would have occurred? he asked.  From 1999 to 2015, more than 183,000 people in the United States died from overdoses related to prescription opioids, according to the . In October, President Donald Trump declared the opioid epidemic a national . At least one company has decided to stop paying doctors for promotional activities such as speaking engagements.  Purdue Pharma discontinued its speakers program for the opioids OxyContin and Butrans at the end of 2016 and the program for Hysingla, another opioid, in November, according to company spokesman Robert Josephson.We have restructured and significantly reduced our commercial operation and will no longer be promoting opioids to prescribers, a company statement said.  Though Thiyagarajah's opioid prescription rates were particularly high, many other doctors who have prescribed large amounts of opioids have also been paid large amounts of money by pharmaceutical companies that make the drugs. Several patients have filed lawsuits against these high prescribers. From August 2013 through December 2016, Dr. Steven Simon of Overland Park, Kansas, was paid nearly $1.1 million by companies that make opioid painkillers, according to the federal . Most of the payments were fees for speaking, training and education. Ballou, one of his patients, says she remembers Simon bragging about how drug companies were flying him across the country to give lectures to other doctors. He said he was going to Miami, and they were going to give him a convertible, and he was going to stay in the best hotel and eat the best Cuban food he'd ever had, said Ballou, who filed a lawsuit against Simon after she says she became addicted to opioids.  Simon's lawyer, James Wyrsch, said he would not comment on pending litigation.  In court documents, he asked for the case to be dismissed, saying in part that Ballou's complaints that Simon improperly prescribed Subsys were simply incorrect.  Bridget Patton, a spokeswoman for the FBI's Kansas City field office, said federal agents went to the office where Simon works, Mid-America PolyClinic, in July. The clinic said in a statement that it is fully and willingly cooperating with all investigations and that Simon has not been employed there since July 24. We had a lawful presence at that facility, Patton said. She declined to say whether investigating Simon himself was the purpose of the FBI visit. The owner of the pain clinic, Dr. Srinivas Nalamachu, told  that the agents showed up with a search warrant for Simon's medical records involving fentanyl prescriptions. Simon and his lawyer told CNN they couldn't comment due to the pending litigation. Ballou said that when she was Simon's patient, it didn't give her pause that the same doctor who was prescribing opioids to her was also taking money from the companies that made the drugs. But now she looks back with anger. Cantone, the patient who went to Thiyagarajah, the pain specialist in South Carolina, looks back with sadness.  She cries as she remembers the Mother's Day card her daughter made her in preschool. The teacher asked each child what their mother liked to do and wrote it on the card.  Her card said her mother liked to sleep.  Instead of saying 'she gives me hugs and kisses or takes me to the park,' it was the years of her finding me on the floor, Cantone said. I feel like I failed as a parent. She becomes angry when she thinks about the hundreds of thousands of dollars her doctor was paid by the drug company.  The medication that was being prescribed to me was for his benefit, not my own, she said.CNN's John Bonifield contributed to this story.

{"title": "The new frontier of doping will modify athletes' DNA", "cate": "health", "content": "In 2008, an Olympic year, Lee Sweeney's phone was ringing nonstop. For a busy physiologist at the University of Pennsylvania's Perelman School of Medicine, that may be expected, but the reason behind the calls wasn't exactly run-of-the-mill.The people on the other end of the line were athletes in search of a particular kind of fix: They wanted him to dope them -- via their genes. In the late 1990s, Sweeney made headlines because of his research on Schwarzenegger mice, which were up to 30% stronger than their average counterparts. Sweeney had been able to isolate the gene responsible for activating a protein -- IGF-1 -- that controls muscle growth and repair. The main focus of his experiments was on how to limit the deterioration of muscles with age, but the results also appealed to athletes in search of a performance boost.Word got out, however, that he was not interested.Ahead of this year's Commonwealth Games, which started April 4, Sweeney's was not such a hot number for athletes in search of an unfair advantage -- possibly because he is now an adviser for the World Anti-Doping Agency.At the beginning, when we first started publishing on this, we did get contacted by high-level athletes, said Sweeney, who's also director of the University of Florida's Myology Institute. These days, it's mostly body builders and people desperate to increase their performance or abilities.Back then, gene therapy -- defined as the technique of using and manipulating genes in order to treat or prevent diseases -- wasn't as established as it is today and wasn't recognised as enough of a threat to be listed as a banned practice in sport. But it soon became known that gene therapies could one day be used for much more than disease.Responding promptly to the possibility, in 2002, the anti-doping agency established gene and cell-doping panels of expert scientists to discuss how best to head off the problem.In 2003, the organization banned gene doping, which it defined as the nontherapeutic use of cells, genes, genetic elements, or modulation of gene expression, having the capacity to enhance performance.This new frontier of doping presented a simple and dark idea: What if there was a way for dopers to never be caught?Now, almost 20 years later, the technology is has finally been used to treat patients with rare diseases -- such as severe combined immunodeficiency, chronic granulomatous disorder, hemophilia, blindness, cancer and neurodegenerative diseases -- by transferring missing genes into skeletal muscles, Sweeney said. So because of that, it is now at a point where potentially it could be used by athletes.It could be done today in athletes if some company and government would put the resources (in) to make it happen, he said.In the case of the Schwarzenegger mice, Sweeney used the classic method of gene therapy, in which he modified the animals' DNA using a virus to deliver and insert the required gene that would make the mice stronger. Genes are delivered into an organism using a vector, the most common being viruses, like that used by Sweeney, which have been modified to be safe and no longer cause disease. The vectors carry the desired gene into targeted cells and, there, unload the genetic material, which in turn instructs the organism to produce the protein the gene encodes. One example of a protein well-known to athletes is erythropoietin, commonly known as EPO, which regulates the production of red blood cells in the body, increasing hemoglobin and oxygen delivery to tissues. With the injection of external EPO, elite athletes -- often cyclists -- have been enhancing performance for years, but authorities have caught on. Anti-doping controls can now  efficiently through blood and urine tests.If extra EPO is being produced organically by a cell's machinery, however, it is almost impossible to detect as a banned substance.But the technology is not quite at that level yet.Making the viruses that are involved in doing the gene transfer is still difficult, Sweeney said, highlighting that the science is still complicated and not something athletes could readily do at home. Another way to dope an athlete's genes is through CRISPR, or CRISPR-Cas9, a technique that allows geneticists to edit specific parts of a person's genome by removing or altering sections of DNA -- also known as gene editing. The technique is rapidly developing, leading to a World Anti-Doping Agency announcement in October that it was expanding its gene-doping ban to gene editing agents designed to alter genome sequences and/or the transcriptional or epigenetic regulation of gene expression.The ban went into effect in January.There's a couple of ways you can use CRISPR-Cas9, Sweeney said. One is to take cells from a person, modify those cells and put them back into the person, and that is probably the safest way to use it.The other way to use it, which is to modify your existent DNA in the body, is potentially very unsafe. Sweeney pointed out that scientists do not know what unintended consequences could come from changing a specific gene in an individual, meaning the technology is not even ready for trials in patients with lethal diseases. In the case of gene-doping through gene therapies, using vectors for delivery, it's relatively easy to look for an extra copy of a gene and confirm that an athlete has been doped when you have access to a biological sample, such as blood, said Olivier Rabin, senior executive director of sciences and international partnerships at the anti-doping agency. In particular, Rabin said, the agency looks at white-blood cells and has developed a methodology that can be applied to search for different genes. Further detail was not provided, as it is kept confidential in order to catch athletes, he added.Gene editing is a little more complex than gene therapy, Rabin added. The anti-doping agency is working on strategies to reveal the possibility of people editing their genes for performance enhancement, he said.Rabin highlighted that most of the agency's efforts focus on white blood cells as pretty good markers of gene manipulation because some evidence of manipulation will usually end up in the blood.Asked what it is doing to monitor and test athletes for gene doping, the International Olympic Committee did not comment directly but said, We have nothing to add to the section on gene doping in WADA's prohibited list.The question now is whether the first few cases have, in fact, happened without our knowledge.I never heard anything about it except for one time, and it was around five years ago, said Sebastian Weber, coach of four-time Union Cycliste Internationale world champion (time trialling) Tony Martin. There was some buzz around a substance called AICAR, or 5-Aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide. AICAR is a performance-enhancing drug that the French Anti-Doping Agency suspected was used in the 2009 Tour de France; it stimulates mitochondria, the part in the muscles responsible for aerobic energy production. In cycling, for gene doping to be effective, techniques should target both EPO levels and red blood cell production to have a higher oxygen delivery to the muscles, Weber says -- but they would also need to increase the mass and number of mitochondria in order to actually produce energy from that oxygen. Just because you have more oxygen, it doesn't necessary mean you also have the capacity to produce energy out of it, Weber said.As AICAR was a drug, it wasn't gene doping, but it led people to wonder about what was next, he says, after this first step toward stimulating the body's mitochondria. That was the only time I heard people talking about the possibility of gene-doping.There are other ways genetics -- and a deep knowledge of them -- could help athletes improve their performance, by understanding their physiology. For example, project GENESIS -- focused on how applied genomics in elite sports can improve performance -- and its offshoot, the RugbyGene Project, are trying to identify which genetic characteristics help athletes succeed. We recognize it is not only genetic, said Dr. Alun Williams, an exercise geneticist at Manchester Metropolitan University in the UK who works on both projects. Training, diet and other lifestyle habits are massive factors. But along with that, the evidence is that it's impossible to have success in sports without some genetic [factors] in your favor.The researchers of these projects are hoping to identify which genes help -- or hinder -- athletes in their specific disciplines, to develop their skills in a more tailored way. For example, if an athlete has shown to have a higher genetic vulnerability to tendon injuries, scientists and coaches could reduce certain aspects of their training load over the course of the season, give longer rest periods, reduce the number of matches played in a season, or provide specific exercises and pre-habilitation workouts.But Williams points out that the field is still at an early stage. This picture where certain genes (or even two or three genes) are related to a particular characteristic, like the tendon injury, is still a small bit of a bigger picture, he said. So it's very important that this information that is available is put into context. Some experts argue that we're looking at it all wrong and that athletes will always use the most modern technology to seek out an advantage -- illegal or not.Modern sports have been principally valued on the basis of record-breaking and being able to witness extraordinary performances, said bioethicist Andy Miah, the University of Salford Chair in Science Communication and Future Media and author of Genetically Modified Athletes: Biomedical Ethics, Gene Doping and Sport. Even if it's not a world record, it's about trying to see something special in what humans can do, and often, that is about transcending boundaries.We give athletes all sort of technology to do that, added Miah, who readily claims to disagree with anti-doping.Instead of the current scenario, in which anti-doping keeps trying to catch up with doping, Miah suggests a safer form of performance enhancement. If we can have a system where enhancement was actually medically supervised, then I think that is a much more safe and healthy.Nick Busca is a triathlon coach, personal trainer and CNN sport and health contributor."},
{"title": "Two dads, an egg donor and a surrogate: How a freezer failure changed everything", "cate": "health", "content": "Their first date was over lunch during a Proposition 8 protest, where they joined hundreds of others railing against the passage of California's same-sex marriage ban. The two men took a break from demonstrating, threw their hearts on the table and talked about their desire to have kids. So it was somehow appropriate that in June 2013, nearly five years later, Bill Taroli and Yang Li stood in a delivery room and welcomed their son, Henry, one day before the US Supreme Court overturned Prop 8. A couple weeks later, with their newborn in their arms, they exchanged vows and were legally married. Having Henry required careful and complicated planning over the course of several years. To become fathers, they needed a support group, legal help, extensive research, reams of documents, reproductive science and about $150,000. But none of that mattered without the help of two women: an egg donor and a surrogate. One embryo brought them Henry. Five remaining healthy embryos they kept frozen in storage at the Pacific Fertility Center in San Francisco. They imagined the sibling they might someday give their son and stayed in touch with the women who'd helped give them life once -- and might again someday. Then came the news in March. A freezer or cryogenic storage tank at the facility failed, causing the level of liquid nitrogen to dip too low and the temperature to rise. The malfunction jeopardized the status of thousands of eggs and embryos inside, potentially crushing the dreams of hundreds of hopeful parents and families.The fate of their embryos would prove significant not just for the fathers but for the women invested in their journey.Taroli, 47, was adopted by his stepfather and was 20 when he first met his biological dad. When he considered pathways to fatherhood, he was open to a variety of options.Li, however, was keen on having a biological child, making the decision of how to proceed easy, Taroli said. Henry got his sperm and my name.  They scrolled through a registry of possible egg donors provided by the fertility center, studying pictures and written statements. They settled on Isabelle, a name chosen by the potential donor, and elected to sit down with her in person. She was a college student living in Sacramento when she spotted an ad about egg donation. She didn't need to do it financially, as she had family support and scholarships, but she liked the idea of extra spending money and looked ahead toward medical school and the enormous expenses to come.Isabelle, the name she preferred to go by for this story, also thought about how fixated she was on not getting pregnant, and her mind turned to those who wanted nothing more.Some people are tying so hard to not have something that other people would absolutely love to have happen to them, she said by Skype from the United Kingdom, where she's beyond medical school and now doing her residency in Wales. I thought, 'I have these eggs. I'm not using them. Someone might as well.'She also liked the idea of taking part in social innovation and helping families who, without someone else's eggs, might never have children.Isabelle's mother was befuddled by and against her daughter's decision to donate eggs.No, no, no -- don't do it, Isabelle remembered her pleading. What's the point? She ended up going through six egg donation cycles and received $7,000 to $8,000 each time, she said. She was fascinated by the science of it all. Her pre-med friends lined up to give her hormone injections. Most of her donation cycles went directly to a frozen egg bank, where they'd be used by people she'd never know or meet. But her first cycle, the experience she appreciated most, went to two men who chose her.She was excited to meet the people who wanted my eggs to be part of their family, she said. When they got together in the clinic offices, Taroli did most of the talking and peppered Isabelle with questions. Li, who didn't want to speak for this story, sat by with a clipboard, she remembered. The few questions Li asked were specific: He wanted to know what it was like to grow up bilingual and multicultural.Isabelle, now 29, has a Portuguese mother and an American father. Henry has American and Chinese dads. And although their backgrounds are different from those of her parents, the couple saw in Isabelle a commonality. She walked away struck by their kindness and thinking how lucky any child of theirs would be.They came to know their embryos well, including their sexes, through chromosomal testing and biopsies of their cells. Taroli explained that they received rankings, which measured their viability, and the ones they stored -- including the one that would become Henry -- represented their best chances to become parents. Next, Taroli and Li had to identify their surrogate.  A traditional surrogate is implanted with embryos using her own eggs, but Taroli and Li opted for a gestational carrier, a surrogate who receives through in-vitro fertilization an embryo using somebody else's eggs. The latter process, if they chose a carrier who also lived in California, would be less legally complicated for the gay dads, Taroli explained.  The woman's name would not appear on Henry's birth certificate. Instead, both of their names would. A few hours north of Castro Valley, the community in the East Bay where Taroli and Li live, the woman who would become their surrogate and her husband were happy to be parents to an only child. But she comes from a big family, in which the women generally have five or six kids, and her pregnancy had been really, really easy, she said.An article she read about surrogacy got her thinking. Though pregnancy had been such a breeze for her, she knew that having a family was often a struggle for others. She thought about how some women feel attached to their babies while they're in the womb and how she didn't. It wasn't until after her son was born that she made a connection.The surrogate asked to be identified as Audrey to protect her privacy. I felt emotionally capable of being a surrogate. I felt physically capable, Audrey said. It seems kind of a waste that I'm so able to carry children but not interested in carrying my own. Her husband, whom she's been with for more than 16 years, also didn't want more children but was in full support of this idea. His mother, Audrey said, was initially disappointed because she still held out hope that they'd give her more grandkids. Audrey's mother and grandmother, however, were completely on board. It was her father, divorced from her mother and living several states away, who had the hardest time understanding. The thought of his daughter delivering somebody else's baby, and being part of a process that might include the destruction of embryos, went against his faith. But the two of them had weathered points of friction before, and Audrey, then 30, was prepared to move forward. It wasn't about the money for her, although the $27,000 came in handy for the then stay-at-home mom.She'd done research into how surrogacy worked and signed up with a surrogacy agency. There were questionnaires for her and her husband to complete, a psychological evaluation she had to clear and medical records that needed to be shared. She suspected that being a surrogate for a woman might become emotionally fraught and was most interested in being a surrogate for a gay couple. She also welcomed the chance to have an ongoing relationship after the birth. The agency learned about Taroli and Li and set up a meeting.With her husband and 3-year-old son with her, Audrey walked into the family-style restaurant the surrogacy agency had selected. It was initially awkward, sort of like heading into a blind date, she said.They brought me flowers, which was really sweet, she remembered. You could tell how much they were trying to impress me.Like her husband who works in IT, so does Taroli; Li is in software development. Their initial shyness was something she understood and liked. As they warmed up, they shared their histories, and the two men spoke openly about their hope to be fathers. They told her that they liked the idea of staying in contact with their surrogate, not just during the pregnancy but after, a proposition that made her smile. She left feeling like, in them, she'd found her match. After some additional testing at the fertility center, Audrey and the couple began to iron out a legal contract.  She laid out what she was -- and wasn't -- comfortable with. She wanted to pick her own doctor and hospital. No more than two embryos could be implanted in her, she said, and she was relieved when they decided to go with just one. She planned to work with a doula, did not want an epidural and would consider a cesarean section only if the doctor deemed it necessary. Eating healthy foods and not smoking were conditions she already chose to live by. And she and her husband would abstain from sexual intercourse in the weeks right before and after the embryo transfer, to make sure she was having Taroli and Li's baby -- not hers. For many people, in vitro fertilization requires repeated tries -- and additional costs -- to work, if it works at all. The first embryo implanted in Audrey took without a hitch. She, Taroli and Li were in touch by email a few times a week, and the dads came along to some of her doctor appointments. They got together at least once a month and came to know each other as her belly grew. Sometimes when they'd visit, the two men would take her and her family out to dinner. They really valued me, Audrey said. They saw me as a person, not just a vessel for their child.She recalled how her own child took the developments in stride. When he was nearly 4 and she was very pregnant, someone asked her son, Aren't you excited you're going to be a brother? The young boy answered, without skipping a beat, That's not going to be my brother. That's Bill and Yang's baby. As her contractions grew stronger in the Redding delivery room, she held off on pushing and screamed out, Are the dads here? Are they here? A nurse rushed Taroli and Li in from the waiting room. They were there to witness Henry's arrival and cut his umbilical cord.Audrey and her husband, who was also in the room, watched as the two new dads fussed with how to put on the first diaper.They were so funny, Audrey, now 36, remembered. They were being a little snippy with each other. I'm sure I was like that with my son, and it was so cute to see that in someone else. Audrey pumped breast milk for Henry for 10 months and stopped sending the UPS shipments on dry ice only once Taroli and Li had enough to get them through their son's first year.She and her family visited Henry's family quite a bit in the beginning. They saw them on Christmas and were at the boy's first birthday party. They've since moved to Los Angeles, where Audrey works as a speech therapist. It's been a couple years since they've seen each other, but they still get updates and pictures. Isabelle and Audrey have not met but have heard about each other. They each received photo books Taroli and Li created to document Henry's first year and how he came into this world. They receive updates and additional photographs, still.  And, as a result, they've seen pictures of one another, as they're both central to Henry's story. Isabelle remembers being a little thrown by the first photograph she spotted of Audrey.I remember thinking, she had my egg inside of her, she said. That's just crazy. Isabelle didn't see Taroli and Li again until Henry was about a 1\u00bd. The couple reached out to the clinic to say they wanted her to meet Henry.I wanted him to have the opportunity to know who was involved in his coming into being, said Taroli, who didn't learn that he was adopted until he was 14.The clinic, in turn, put the query to Isabelle. She was living in the UK at the time but would be returning to California for Christmas.Isabelle's mother, who had opposed her daughter's decision to donate eggs, suddenly couldn't wait for her chance to meet the boy. That would come later. The first visit with Taroli, Li and Henry was Isabelle's alone. As she drove across the Golden Gate Bridge, she began to grow nervous. She was fresh off a breakup, emotionally raw and worried that she might see Henry and suddenly want him. She feared that she'd lay eyes on him and believe, This is my baby, she said. But then, when I got there and I saw Henry, he couldn't have cared less, she said with a laugh. I was just another person in the room. Yes, he's genetically my son, but he's not my son. He was more interested in the tissue box than me. She tries to see them whenever she's in California and appreciates the photos they send her. Her mother gushes over pictures of Henry and is probably more attached to him than I am, Isabelle said. Sometimes she wonders, if Taroli and Li had had a girl, whether she would have seen herself more in the child. She knew that there was a female embryo in the tank and thought about what might come later.Taroli and Li told her, at one point, that if she ever found herself single or struggling to get pregnant, she was welcome to use embryos they didn't use.It would be quite ironic, wouldn't it? asked Isabelle, who faces years of continued medical training and hopes to be an obstetrician-gynecologist some day. The option of using their embryos, if she needed them someday, stayed in the back of her mind.Taroli was texting with his mom, with his television on in the background, when a national story caught his eye. He recognized the lobby of the Pacific Fertility Clinic but thought it was just generic footage, he said, to complement a report on a failed fertility clinic storage tank in Cleveland, Ohio.He had to rewind and watch the piece three or four times before the truth sunk in. The very same weekend that Cleveland experienced a tank malfunction, so did San Francisco.He fired off an email to the fertility clinic, not knowing whether this freezer failure affected them. Li, who is establishing a new business in China, was abroad, so Taroli sent him a message, too, with a link to the TV segment. A day or two later, Taroli said, he got a late evening call from the clinic, confirming that their embryos were in the ill-fated tank. To find out whether the embryos were destroyed, however, would take further testing. To test an embryo requires that it be thawed first, which -- in turn -- might damage the embryo, Taroli explained. He and Li decided they would approve testing, one embryo at a time. If the first was still OK, they could hope that the others were, too. So we did that, Taroli said over coffee in April. They all came back dead. With thousands of miles and the Pacific Ocean between them, the couple processed what this meant for them.They were viable lives. They were potential babies, four boys and a girl, that if we chose to could have been our kids, Taroli said. It's not about the death of a child; it's not the same thing. ... It's the death of the possibility. And it's the death of what might have been for Henry, who'd lost the chance to have biological siblings.Taroli was playing the role of solo parent during Li's China trip. He got choked up when he spoke about their son, who recently turned 5, and the extra big hugs he was getting. If I get upset, he cries, Taroli said. I've been careful not to talk about it in front of him. It was important to Taroli to break the news to Isabelle and Audrey. They were part of the fertility journey from the start, and they deserved to know how it ended.Before he got to Isabelle, though, she got an email from the Pacific Fertility Clinic. The clinic wanted to know, out of the blue, whether she'd be open to donating eggs again. She explained where she now lived but said she'd be interested if they wanted to talk. She got a call almost immediately. If the clinic wanted to fly her to California or could wait until she was there for a visit, she said, she'd be willing to go through a donation cycle, she said. She was told they'd reach out again if they needed her.The exchange got her thinking about Henry and her experience. She talked to a friend about it that night and wondered aloud about how big Henry must be.When she woke up at 4 a.m., she said, she had an email from Taroli, telling her about the storage tank failure. She began to wonder whether the clinic had only called her because it had lost her eggs and their embryos. Taroli too found the timing odd. Why would they reach out to Isabelle without knowing whether he and Li were even interested in going through this again, he wondered. The clinic, contacted several times for clarification on this and other questions, would not comment for this story.The news of the lost embryos both shocked and saddened Isabelle.For some reason, I kept thinking about the little girl egg, she said, and the potential that was lost for all the embryos. They would never become people. But then, I guess, we always knew that they wouldn't all ever become real people, right?Isabelle told Taroli that if he and Li ever wanted to try again, her eggs were theirs.Audrey's heart sunk too for the couple when she got the news from Taroli. She knew from a previous conversation that they were on the fence about when -- or if -- they'd have a second child, but she hated that the option was taken away from them.Because her experience with Taroli and Li was so wonderful, Audrey went on to be a gestational carrier once more a few years later. But the second time she did it for an opposite-sex couple, and the experience was awful in comparison. That couple demanded that doctors speak only to them and wanted to manage all aspects of her life. Audrey felt like nothing more than a vessel.After that, she said, she couldn't imagine being a surrogate again -- unless it was for Taroli and Li.They were so great, and I love them so much, Audrey said. I would do it a million times over again for them. Taroli and Li knew this.Pacific Fertility Center formally offered to cover all costs for another round, and their doctor, whom they don't blame in any way, was eager to have them go through the process again. But Taroli and Li, after processing the shock, mourning the loss and coming to terms with where their lives are now, have decided they aren't interested in going through this again. They're getting older, they love their life with Henry, Li's new business in China will require lots of travel and time apart, and now is not the time for them to have more children.The truth is, they may have never used those embryos, but they would have liked to make that decision on their own terms.If we were really eager to have a second child still or didn't have Henry yet, our thinking might have been different, Taroli said. We're happy with where we are. Meantime, attorneys are signing on clients for lawsuits against the clinic, but Taroli said they can't imagine dragging this out. They don't need to take part to find closure. Yes, they want to understand what went wrong with the tank that held their embryos, most of all because they want to be sure it doesn't happen again. I work in tech, where lives aren't on the line, Taroli said. You improve your process and put something better in place until the next thing you couldn't anticipate happens. He doesn't judge those who are seeking legal remedies, and he knows that for some, for instance those who froze embryos before undergoing treatment for cancer, what happened is a tragedy of different proportions.But for him and Li, they will love the child they do have, stay honest with Henry about where he came from and give him every chance to know the women who helped him get here. And someday, when the time is right and he asks why he never had siblings, they'll find the words to explain. "},
{"title": "Historic face transplant gives suicide survivor a 'second chance'", "cate": "health", "content": "As Katie Stubblefield brushed her fingers across her face, she could feel the wound.Her vision is greatly impaired due to her injury, but touching her face allowed her to feel what her doctors were working around the clock to treat. She could feel where her face was swollen. She could feel the portions that were missing.That was before Katie, at 21, became the youngest person in the United States to receive a face transplant. The transplant, performed last year, aims to restore Katie's face structure and functions -- such as chewing, breathing and swallowing -- which were lost in a severe gunshot injury, the haunting outcome of a suicide attempt as a teenager.Now, Katie hopes to use her historic surgery to raise awareness about the lasting harms of suicide and the precious value of life.She is featured on the cover of , which debuted Tuesday, in an article titled The Story of a Face and in National Geographic's full-length documentary Katie's Face.In the days prior to Katie's suicide attempt, she faced a number of emotional hurdles. She underwent surgery for chronic gastrointestinal problems, and she faced betrayal in a personal relationship. Around that time, Katie's mother, Alesia, was abruptly fired from a teaching job at Katie's school because Alesia questioned several decisions that were made lacking integrity, Katie's father, Robb, told CNN.On March 25, 2014, when Katie was 18, her older brother, Robert Stubblefield, heard the gunfire and found her after she harmed herself in a bathroom at his home in Mississippi.He was devastated.Katie doesn't remember that tragic day when she lost her face. She has said that she doesn't remember much of that year -- including being hospitalized in Oxford, Mississippi; being flown to another hospital in Memphis, Tennessee; and then being transferred to Cleveland Clinic in Ohio, where she would undergo her face transplantation three years later. It was in Memphis where Katie's parents, Robb and Alesia, heard the term face transplant for the first time. There was an older trauma surgeon who basically told us, 'It's the worst wound that I've ever seen of its kind,' and he said, 'The only thing I can think of that would really give her functional life again is a face transplant,'  Robb said. I was standing there thinking, 'What do you mean, a facetransfer? What do you do?' When Katie was later told about the possible procedure, she said, she was equally stunned.I had no clue what a face transplant was, Katie said. When my parents helped explain everything to me, I was very excited to get a face again and to have function again.Full and partial  are medical procedures that involve replacing all or parts of a person's face with donated tissue, including skin, bone, nerves and blood vessels from a deceased donor.Katie's procedure involved transplanting the scalp, forehead, upper and lower eyelids, eye sockets, nose, upper cheeks, upper jaw and half of lower jaw, upper teeth, lower teeth, partial facial nerves, muscles and skin -- effectively replacing her full facial tissue, according to .Similar to Katie, the  in the United States was a woman who survived a gunshot wound to the head. That patient, Connie Culp, underwent a 22-hour transplant surgery at Cleveland Clinic and debuted her new face in 2009.That was a near-total face transplant. The world's  was conducted at Vall d'Hebron University Hospital in Barcelona, Spain, in 2010.As for where Katie fits in, only 40 people in the world have ever had a face transplant, and we believe that she is the 39th person, said Susan Goldberg, .We think her story is one of the most important stories that we will do this year, Goldberg said of the magazine. We thought it was just such a moving and inspiring story that is about everything from human journey to breakthrough medicine and science.Before Katie's face transplantation, surgeons at Cleveland Clinic used 3D printing to help reconstruct about 90% of her lower jaw, said Dr. Brian Gastman, a  who led Katie's surgery and oversaw her care.The surgical team used CT scans of the jaw of Katie's older sister, Olivia McCay, to 3D-print a model template for the reconstruction.We made a plate designed for the combination of Katie and her sister's jaw, and that's what we used to make Katie's jaw before we did the transplant, Gastman said.He noted that when he first saw Katie's injury, he worried that she might not live.In March 2016, Katie was placed on the waiting listfor a face transplant. Fourteen months later, a donor was found: Adrea Schneider, a 31-year-old woman who died of a drug overdose, National Geographic reported. Before the procedure, Katie underwent extensive psychological evaluation as a face transplant candidate and suicide survivor. After she was cleared to receive her new face, the 31-hour surgery began May 4, 2017. It involved 11 surgeons, several other specialists and virtual reality. The surgery was completed the next day.I am able to touch my face now, and it feels amazing, said Katie, who still has some difficulty speaking clearly.Her father, Robb, translated some of her sentiments: You take it for granted, the different components of our faces -- the bone, the tissue, the muscle, everything -- but when it's gone, you recognize the big need. Then when you receive a transplant, you're so thankful.Katie was discharged from Cleveland Clinic on August 1, 2017. She takes immunosuppressive drugs to reduce her risk of , which occurs when a transplant recipient's immune system attacks the transplanted organ or tissue. She will continue to take the medication for the rest of her life.Katie also continues physical and occupational therapy, works with a speech therapist and takes Braille lessons.I'm definitely taking many, many daily steps, Katie said of her rehab progress, adding that her family has been a big help in her recovery and that her faith has kept her strong.Life is precious, and life is beautiful, she said.Face transplantation is considered experimental, and insurance companies, Medicare and Medicaid don't cover it. A grant from the US Department of Defense, through the , covered Katie's transplant, according to National Geographic. The institute works to develop advanced treatment options -- including  -- for severely wounded servicemen and -women.I remember Dr. Gastman mentioned to me, he said basically that Katie was kind of the quintessential potential candidate for a face transplant. One, because of the type of wound that she suffered, but also she is in that age bracket of so many soldiers, Robb said. She's in that late-teen to early 20s, where so many young soldiers are being wounded and injured.While Katie's medical care team hopes that her surgery can advance the field of face transplantation, there are many other hopes for her future.Katie plans to attend college online soon, possibly followed by a career in counseling and motivational speaking. She hopes to raise awareness about suicide and suicide prevention.My first wish for Katie is to be happy, Gastman said. That's number one, but beyond that, I'd like her to have some level of normalcy, he said. Then, she can do all that and become a spokeswoman for so many aspects -- for how to be strong in the face of adversity and not to make a singular decision dictate who you are. Further, on the other hand, how much a singular rash decision made by so many young people today could negatively change your whole life.He said Katie had the ultimate second chance.Suicide awareness remains critical, said Katie's mother, Alesia.Globally, close to 800,000 people die due to suicide every year, which is about one person every 40 seconds, according to the . In the US,  in 44 states from 1999 through 2016, according to a report published in June by the . Nearly  to suicide in 2016, and more than half of people who died by suicide did not have a known mental health condition.In 2016, guns were the most common method used in suicide deaths in the US, accounting for 22,963 -- almost half of all -- suicide deaths, according to the .Among young people, I think we do a pretty decent job of educating them about sex and about drinking and driving, but education around suicide prevention is lacking, Alesia said.I can honestly tell you, for Katie, we do not believe for one moment that she wanted to die, Alesia said. But we do believe she hit that low where she definitely tried and thought about it, and for a moment -- 20 seconds or less -- kids can make those decisions."},
{"title": "Why a terminally ill young woman has changed her mind about living", "cate": "health", "content": "To face each day, Claire Wineland undergoes hours of breathing treatments. It's a reality of living with cystic fibrosis she's come to accept.But last month, as the nebulizer hummed loudly in her La Jolla, California, hotel room, she breathed in medicine through her mask and hoped this day would be the first step toward something different. She'd traveled from Los Angeles with her mother, her best friend and her pit bull, Daisy, who flopped down on the floor atop one of Claire's ever-present oxygen tubes. A full day of appointments at a nearby medical center awaited her, when she would begin the evaluation process to see whether she might be a candidate for a double-lung transplant. A year earlier, Claire vowed that she'd never have the major surgery.It's not for me and never has been, she said at the time. She was more comfortable dealing with the illness she knew than taking on the unknown. She preferred to focus on leading a purposeful life than worrying about death and how to dodge it. A series of irreversible setbacks and some painful soul-searching, however, have prompted an about-face in her thinking. Claire, 21, needs new lungs, or she will die -- sooner than she's willing to accept. The only question is: Did her change of heart come too late? It wasn't as if the clouds parted and she suddenly saw the light. Claire's new outlook was the result of a messy and humbling self-reckoning.She had long managed to push through physical discomfort to lead a life that mattered. After emerging from a 16-day medically induced coma at age 13, she envisioned the , which today provides financial support to struggling families affected by cystic fibrosis. She appeared in brutally honest viral videos in which  and did it with a smile. Since she was 14, she had been taking to stages and wowing audiences with beyond-her-years wisdom. Along the way, she nurtured a love of travel.She was wrapping up a three-city tour last fall when pneumonia landed her in a Philadelphia hospital for two weeks.Doctors there sat her down and told Claire she had to stop flying. Period. They told her that her lungs could collapse and that she ran the risk of dropping dead on a plane, she said. They warned that it would be painful and laid out what it would feel like if an air pocket in her lungs burst. You will feel like you're being stabbed to death ... and then blood will stop flowing to your brain, she remembered them saying. And I was like, 'OK, I got the message! Copy that!'  She took a three-day train ride home and began to settle down.Cystic fibrosis affects more than 30,000 people in the United States (and more than 70,000 worldwide), according to the . The disease causes an overabundance of mucus, which traps infections and blocks airways in the lungs, complicates digestion, affects the pancreas and other organs and, eventually, leads to respiratory failure. The median survival age is about 40,  -- a great improvement from the 1950s, when surviving long enough to attend elementary school was rare. Claire became uber-diligent with her care. She was on top of her dozens of medications, including her shots for cystic fibrosis-related diabetes, endured as best she could the feeding tube at night, even though it made her throw up, and spent extra time with her breathing treatments. For four hours daily, she said, she wore a vest to shake her lungs and loosen mucus. She also tried supplements like turmeric and found comfort in the nettle infusions she drank throughout the day. But even with all of this, her lung function continued to decline. In one year, she said her working lung capacity fell 10 points -- from 35% to 25%. Short walks and visits to the beach left this lover of the outdoors exhausted. Simple grocery shopping became too tough to manage. She had no energy for local speaking engagements and lost her income flow. She felt homebound, trapped and unable to do what mattered to her most.CFers, as she refers to people with cystic fibrosis, often talk about the Wheelchair Decision with dread, Claire said. But when breathing and getting around became too difficult and she got hers in February, it initially felt like freedom. With her best friend, Larissa, taking on the role of designated wheeler, the duo could tool around outside. The day she got the wheelchair, they went on a seven-hour adventure around Los Angeles' Venice Beach, where Claire lives, visiting the canals, going to the park, soaking in the ocean breeze.And while most of the time, she has no qualms about needing a wheelchair, there are accessibility issues, the sidewalks are a mess, and she can't be pushed through sand. Inevitably, she's had those moments when she thinks, It sucks that I need this. It's painful that it's gotten this far.Then Claire, who's undergone more than 30 surgeries and been in the hospital a quarter of her life, received another jolt during a March hospital stay. Medical staff discovered that her portacath wasn't working. The small dome under the skin of her chest provides a central line into a vein, allowing easy administration of IV treatments -- such as antibiotics, which she must take regularly to beat back constant infections. A portacath replacement means surgery, and Claire's pulmonary function was -- and remains -- at a level too dangerous for her to go under anesthesia. Though the portacath was fixable, Claire didn't know it would be at the time. A wave of terror washed over her. She fell apart and realized it was time to take the transplant idea seriously.I can't go under anesthesia. I can't fly. I can't do anything, she remembered feeling with a panic. I have completely locked myself in a position of not being able to do anything besides die.After leaving the La Jolla hotel, Claire was wheeled into the Center for Transplantation at UC San Diego Health, prepared to meet with members of the lung transplant team. She'd eaten a McDonald's McGriddle sandwich the day before -- a secret she employs to put on an extra pound or two before weigh-ins -- just in case they asked her and her 95-pound frame to step on a scale. She was armed with questions and a notepad, ready to studiously record all she'd learn. Since she'd been here less than two years earlier and decided against pursuing the transplant path then, she was eager to tell them why this time was different. A nurse who serves as the lung transplant coordinator, Megan Serletti, spent several hours educating Claire, her mom and Larissa about the process. They talked about the battery of tests that would determine whether she would qualify to get on the waiting list, some of which Claire knew well and described as gnarly. They discussed the lung allocation score, the number Claire will get if she's approved that measures how sick she is and determines where she sits on the priority list.They discussed what life on a waitlist looks like: the necessity that she stay within a four-hour drive of the center, the importance of not ignoring phone calls, the exercise she'd need to grow stronger and the multitude of blood draws and exams she'd have on her schedule.We call a transplant your marathon, Serletti said. We tell people to train for your marathon. The day you get called is the day of the race.There were forms to sign and questions she'd need to consider. For example, would she be willing to accept lungs from a prostitute? I'm fine if a donor had sex in exchange for money, Claire quipped. Way to bring the hustle.How about from someone who was an IV drug user and contracted hepatitis C, a condition that is treatable?Honestly, I'd just laugh if I got new lungs and caught something else, she said. I already have the body of someone who's been around the block. Serletti spoke of the realities after surgery, including the drugs Claire would need to take for the rest of her life, the physical and emotional challenges she might face, the changes in lifestyle she'd have to honor. Claire wrote everything down. She curled her legs into the chair, revealing the tattoo on her left ankle: the thumbs-up Don't Panic logo from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. None of it spooked me, Claire said afterward, over lunch in the transplantation center's courtyard. Now that I'm looking at it as something I have to do, I don't care about any of the side effects. I'm willing to deal with anything.To qualify for new lungs, a person must be sick enough to need a transplant yet strong enough to withstand the surgery and recovery.  There were 1,436 candidates for lung transplants as of April 20, according to the , which manages the nation's organ waiting lists. Of those, 122 had a primary diagnosis of cystic fibrosis. Last year, of the total 2,449 lung transplants performed, CFers accounted for nearly 11% of the recipients. A lung transplant is not a cure, but it can extend a life, if all goes well.Of those who received lung transplants (not just CFers), dating to 2000, an average of 84% survived after one year, nearly 54% survived five years, and slightly more than 30% survived 10 years or more, according to the organ sharing network's data. Deciding to go for a lung transplant, let alone a double-lung transplant (the only option for CFers), is no small matter. Claire first visited a transplantation center at UCLA when she was 14 but said that was too early for the idea to make sense for her. At 17, she checked out the program at Stanford University but was turned down, her mom explained, because they could tell that Claire wasn't interested. She checked out the option again, at the very place she had returned to now, when she was 19. While her peers were being tasked with picking out prom dresses or decorating dorm rooms, she was being asked to contemplate her mortality. She prayed that she'd want it as much as she knew her parents and doctors did, but her heart wasn't in it, she said. She was still happy with what she had and, as an adult, able to make her own decisions.Her parents, who split up when Claire was 3, struggled to make peace with her choice. Just think of it as insurance, even if you don't want to do it, her mother, Melissa Nordquist Yeager, pleaded at first. Get on the list so you can change your mind.But ever since she'd been a small child, Claire had a sense of self, an understanding of her condition and a sort of intuition Yeager needed to trust -- even if it made her uncomfortable.Her dad, John Wineland, said Claire has a relationship with her body that is sacred and described his daughter's thinking: This is the body I came in with. This is the body I'm going out with. And as her parent, he said, I have to live with it.To see her struggle and deteriorate over the past year was both sobering and excruciating for them. So when Claire broke down and said she'd changed her mind, they were thrilled, excited and terrified. I was blown away, so grateful, happy and hopeful. It was a sign that she wasn't willing to give up, remembered Yeager, who was with Claire at the hospital in March and heard the news first. I called her dad, and we both just started crying, Yeager said.I'm just praying my ass off, really, that everything goes smoothly, that she can get a shot at more time on the planet, Claire's dad said. There are a lot of hoops she has to jump through to be accepted.It's not uncommon for CFers to change their minds about transplant, social worker Leslie Fijolek assured Claire.Fijolek, who serves on the transplant team, remembered Claire from the last time she visited UC San Diego Health. Fijolek's job is to think about who are these [new] lungs going to live with, she said, get a sense of the care system recipients have in place and provide support to make the process successful for everyone involved.Is Claire compliant in taking her medications? Is she prepared to relocate near the transplantation center, where she'll need to be for at least three months after the transplant if she gets one? Who'd move with her and drive her to appointments?How's your mood been? Any depression and anxiety? Fijolek asked.Claire mentioned how her decline, starting last fall, threw her into a depression. They talked about how she'd lost the ability to manage her physical decline, how she'd like to find a therapist who works with patients facing chronic illness, how she turns to arts and crafts projects to get out of bed -- and out of her head -- on rough days. Photos on a cell phone are passed around, showing the papier-mache tree she's been working on and how the bark and surrounding foliage are remarkably true to life.Fijolek turned serious, locked eyes with Claire and said what everyone in the room already understood: You know you need a transplant.I was so young. I was so na\u00efve, Claire answered, describing where she was before. All the side effects used to scare the shit out of me. My relationship to transplant and all it entails has changed.Fijolek, who was all too familiar with Claire's past ambivalence, pushed her further.Let's say you got listed in about two weeks; it means you can get a call at any time, she said. Are you ready?Claire assured her she is.It's a big change from where you were, the social worker said.I didn't want to waste anyone's time, Claire answered.Her mother sat by, fanning herself with a medical brochure, listened and wiped a tear from her eye.The last appointment of the day was with one of the transplant team's pulmonologists.Dr. Kamyar Afshar got down to the nitty gritty. He wanted to know what antibiotics still worked for her, how many bowel movements she has a day and the last time she coughed up blood.Two days ago, she told him. It's usually one or two times a month.He prescribed walks every day to build up her endurance and suggested she increase her continuous oxygen flow from her normal 2 liters per minute to 6 liters per minute when exercising. He looked down at her worn Birkenstocks and said, Your shoes will have to change.The doctor cranked up her oxygen and told her that if she wanted to get a transplant, she'd need to be able to do 15 sits-to-stands in a minute. He said this was non-negotiable. She won't be able to use her arms after the surgery to get up from a chair or bed, he explained.He asked her to climb off the exam table and show him some squats. Claire -- who used to do yoga six days a week, loved to swim and even went through a phase when she did difficult workout videos like P90X with her dad -- crossed her arms in front of her chest and showed the doctor all she had. For the first time that day, her cheeks had color. I don't anticipate you'd be on the list for too long, Afshar blurted out. Given her blood type and her condition, he said, she'd probably get a transplant within three months of being approved -- if she's approved.Claire's eyes opened wide, and her mom appeared to melt into her chair. Suddenly, it seemed real.Three months! Yeager said outside the center. That made me want to throw up a little bit.I'm a little overwhelmed, Claire said. I need to go back to the hotel and binge-watch 'Real Housewives.' I want to see white women fight over nothingness.The truth is, according to Claire, not longing for different lungs for most of her life served her well. She was able to work with what I had in front of me, she said, rather than fixate on what she didn't have. She also suppressed that part of herself that might have simply dreamed of something more. If I had told myself things could be better than they are now, I think I would have driven myself crazy with frustration and jealousy over other people's lives, she said. In changing her mind, she said she had to swallow some of her pride and open this floodgate of emotion that I kept really deeply buried.A slew of tests still awaited Claire, but she was now all in. She had opened herself up to the possibility that life -- for her -- could be different and not as challenging. For the first time ever, I'm going there, and it's really scary, she said. Now that I actually want something better, what if it doesn't happen? What if I don't get it? What if it goes wrong?The pressure is on, and Claire can only hope that she will be given her chance. "},
{"title": "Escape from the Mayo Clinic: Parents break teen out of world-famous hospital", "cate": "health", "content": "One winter afternoon last year, Duane Engebretson sat in his stepdaughter's hospital room at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, trying to figure out how she could escape. Alyssa Gilderhus, 18 and a senior in high school, had been a patient at Mayo for about two months, ever since having a ruptured brain aneurysm on Christmas Day. Mayo neurosurgeons saved her life, but she and her parents were unhappy with the care she was receiving in the rehabilitation unit, and they say they repeatedly asked for her to be transferred. But they say Mayo refused to let her transfer to another hospital, even after a lawyer wrote a letter asking Mayo to make the arrangements. Alyssa and her family began to suspect that Mayo was trying to get a guardian appointed to make medical decisions for her. They were right: Hospital staffers would later tell police that they had gone to two county adult protection agencies to make guardianship arrangements. Duane and his wife, Amber Engebretson, weren't sure how to get their daughter out of Mayo. Two nurses had been assigned to watch over her at all times. But on February 28, 2017, an idea struck Duane as he sat in Alyssa's hospital room. He looked at one of the nurses. She had been with them a few weeks before, when Alyssa's great-grandmother had come for a visit.  Betty Stalheim was 80. She'd just had knee surgery. She was fragile. If he told the nurses that Grandma Betty wanted to visit but couldn't make it all the way upstairs to Alyssa's room, it might just sound believable, he figured.  He put his plan into action about 4 p.m., with his 9-year-old daughter, Allie, secretly videotaping with a small GoPro camera hidden in her hand. He told CNN he wanted the videotape to show that Alyssa had left the hospital willingly and that he hadn't been violent with staff, and to record actions taken by Mayo employees.  Duane told the nurses he wanted to take Alyssa downstairs to say hello to Grandma Betty in the lobby.The video shows Duane pushing Alyssa in her wheelchair down the hospital hallway. She has a bandage on her neck where her breathing tube had been removed a few days before.Two women in scrubs follow them.When the group arrives in the lobby, there is no Grandma Betty.  Duane says he sees Grandma Betty's car at the entrance and walks out the hospital doors with the two staff members trailing behind him.As he approaches the car, the front passenger door opens.There is no Grandma Betty. She was never there. Instead, Alyssa's mother is in the driver's seat.Alyssa, we're going to go home, honey. Come on, Amber says to her daughter.As Duane helps his stepdaughter out of the wheelchair and into the passenger seat, the two women in scrubs run toward her, and someone yells, No! Yes, she is! Yes, she is! Duane and Amber yell back.The video shows a hand grabbing Alyssa's arm as Duane helps her into the car. A nursing aide would later tell police she had tried to grab her.Get your hands off my daughter, Duane yells at the aide.Duane closes the car door and gets in the back seat.Get out of here, Amber, he tells his wife. Go, go, go, go, go, go!The car drives away from Mayo.  Recalling her escape some months later, Alyssa says it felt phenomenal.It was like the biggest weight off my shoulders, she said. At 4:28 p.m., a Rochester Police dispatcher received a call from Mayo Clinic security.  We have a patient abduction, the caller said. An officer arrived on the scene 20 minutes later. A Mayo social worker told him that Alyssa cannot make decisions for herself and that her mother couldn't care for her because Amber has mental health issues.The social worker also told police she understood there was no formal diagnosis for Amber.Amber told CNN she has no history of mental illness and took offense to the social worker making such an unqualified pronouncement.  It's absolutely absurd, Amber said. She said it to the police department. She has no reasoning. She has no justification. The social worker told the police she'd been working with adult protection services in two Minnesota counties trying to get emergency guardianship but had been unable to get court orders to do so.An Olmsted County Adult Protective Services official told police that Mayo was requesting [assistance] in gaining guardianship of Alyssa because they were concerned for the mother's mental health and the medical decisions that were being made for Alyssa. But something didn't quite make sense to John Sherwin, captain of investigations for the Rochester Police Department.  If Alyssa couldn't make decisions for herself, as the social worker had said, and if she needed a legal guardian appointed for her, then who had been making decisions for her while she was in the hospital?  When police asked that question of Mayo staffers, Sherwin said, they replied that Alyssa had been making her own medical decisions.   When doctors were consulting with her in regards to her medical care, they weren't doing so through a guardian or someone that had been appointed by the courts. It was in direct contact with the patient, Sherwin said.  He said it became clear to investigators that Alyssa in fact could make decisions on her own -- including the decision to leave the hospital against medical advice.  There was no abduction. This was done under her own will, he said. You had a patient that left the hospital under their own planning.Though satisfied that Alyssa was capable of making her own decisions, Sherwin still was concerned about her health.  What was relayed to us [by Mayo staff] was that the patient was in danger of dying if they were not in the hospital, Sherwin said.Mayo sent the police an order for a 72-hour hold, which allows police to admit someone to a hospital emergency room against their will if they're a danger to themselves. But first, the police had to find Alyssa.  Alyssa and her parents were on the run. They weren't answering their cell phones, and they weren't at home, either.They later told CNN they figured the police would bring Alyssa to a hospital, and given the large number of Mayo facilities in Minnesota, there was a good chance that hospital would be a Mayo hospital.  We felt that if [Mayo] got their hands on her, they would latch on and we wouldn't get her back again, Duane said. Unable to find the family, the police pinged their cell phones. This pointed them to an Applebee's restaurant in Mankato, Minnesota, about 85 miles west of Rochester. Officers searched the restaurant and a nearby Five Guys but couldn't find Alyssa, according to a Mankato police report.It turned out the ping was a bit off: The family was down the street at Walmart, purchasing a wheelchair, a walker and a syringe for Alyssa's feeding tube, which Duane says he'd been trained to use.  They then checked into a nearby hotel.  While at the hotel, the family received a phone call from a Martin County sheriff's deputy. They say they told the deputy that their daughter was doing well, and they planned to bring her to a doctor the next day to get her checked. The deputy said that wasn't good enough. He told them they were on their way to them, according to the family. Alyssa and her parents scrambled and left the hotel. It was now almost 9 p.m., and nearly five hours had passed since they'd left Mayo. The family was on the road with three police agencies -- Rochester, Mankato and Martin County -- on their heels. As Alyssa's stepfather drove down the highway, a sheriff's deputy called, urging them to bring their daughter to a hospital right away. They told him they'd bring her to a hospital in Jackson, about 75 miles away. But then, the family reconsidered. They'd chosen Jackson because it had a hospital that wasn't owned by Mayo. But they feared that the doctors there might transfer her to a Mayo facility. After the calls from police, Alyssa's parents figured out that their phones were being pinged and took the batteries out.   They got off the highway and drove on gravel roads without a map.  I just kept heading west. I knew I would run into South Dakota sooner or later, he said. The next afternoon, March 1, one of Alyssa's doctors, a pediatric rehabilitation specialist at Mayo, spoke on the phone with Sherry Bush-Seim, a Rochester police investigator.The doctor warned that Alyssa was in grave danger.The longer she's away, the higher likelihood that she's gonna get very, very sick, the physician said, according to a transcript of the conversation that police provided to CNN. The day Alyssa left Mayo, that doctor and a colleague had written a discharge note.  Alyssa's medical condition, medical status, cognition, and physical impairments require an ongoing inpatient level of medical care, the doctors wrote. She was not medically or functionally safe to leave the hospital at the time of her removal from the hospital by her stepfather.Alyssa was at risk for pneumonia, malnourishment, dehydration, aspiration, infection and falling, according to the note. She\u202fdidn't have her medications with her, and her parents weren't trained on how to use her feeding tube, according to the discharge summary.The doctor said Alyssa was probably a ways from here by now and requested a wider-scale search.[It's] incredibly frustrating that something isn't out nationally given that [this] family may be hopping from doctor to doctor, the doctor said.We wouldn't do that nationally, Bush-Seim responded. That wouldn't be done.Without a national search, the doctor said, we're not gonna find her.Bush-Seim assured the physician that the Rochester police had done everything they possibly could to find her.There's got to be something more. This kid is in danger, Alyssa's doctor responded.But other doctors disagreed with the Mayo physician. Less than 12 hours after leaving Mayo, she and her parents arrived at the emergency room for Sanford Medical Center in Sioux Falls, a teaching hospital for the University of South Dakota.  They explained to Sanford doctors that she'd had an aneurysm and left Mayo against medical advice, according to medical records from that emergency room visit. The Sanford doctors disagreed with the Mayo doctors on two crucial points.  Although Mayo doctors had insisted that Alyssa needed to be in the hospital, the Sanford doctors came to the opposite conclusion: They prescribed Alyssa medications, gave instructions for her to follow up with a doctor and told her she could go home.Mayo had determined that Alyssa lacked the mental capacity to make her own decisions. The Sanford doctors again came to the opposite conclusion: They allowed her to make her own decisions and sign her own forms consenting to treatment. When police learned that a hospital had cleared Alyssa to go home, they stepped aside. If a doctor at another facility says she's fine and comes up with a second opinion, that kind of takes the law out of it, said Chris Vasvick, a Martin County sheriff's deputy. That's one doctor's opinion against another, and that doesn't have anything to do with law enforcement at all. Sherwin, the Rochester detective, agreed.  We didn't have any reason for the police to intervene, Sherwin said.He added that Alyssa and her parents had done nothing illegal. No charges were filed against them.As parents, they were probably thinking that they were acting on her best interest. I think the same could be said for the doctors and staff at Mayo Clinic. I think that they also felt they were acting on her best interest, Sherwin said.   A few days after her visit to the Sanford emergency room, Alyssa and her parents went home.  A letter from Mayo was waiting for them, thanking Duane for getting in touch with the patient experience office.   The family found it ironic, given that it was dated  March 1, the day after Alyssa left the hospital.  A few days later, another letter arrived from an administrator at Mayo, saying that it would not treat Alyssa or her parents.  We have made this decision because of your actions which demonstrate a lack of trust and confidence in Mayo, the administrator wrote.  On Facebook, Amber shared that Alyssa's health was improving.  This kid amazes me every day!! And we all could not be more proud!! she wrote.To understand the legal and ethical issues in Alyssa's case, CNN showed experts key documents, including law enforcement reports; a transcript of portions of CNN's interview with Sherwin, the detective at the Rochester Police Department; and summaries of her care written by doctors at Mayo and Sanford.  The experts emphasized that those documents don't tell the whole story; only a thorough reading of her full medical records and interviews with Mayo staff would provide a complete picture. You're only hearing one side, cautioned Dr. Chris Feudtner, a professor of pediatrics, medical ethics and health policy at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine.After reviewing the documents, the experts wondered why Mayo did not allow Alyssa, who was 18 and legally an adult, to leave the hospital when she made clear that she wanted to be transferred, according to the family.  They said that typically, adult patients have the right to leave the hospital against medical advice, and they can leave without signing any paperwork. Hospitals aren't prisons. They can't hold you there against your will, said George Annas, an attorney and director of the Center for Health Law, Ethics & Human Rights at the Boston University School of Public Health.  But Alyssa's doctors say she wasn't a typical patient.   Due to the severity of her brain injury, she does not have the capacity to make medical decisions, her doctors wrote in her records after she'd left the hospital.  In that report, the doctors specified that assessments in the last week of her hospital stay showed that she lacked the capacity to decide to sign releases of information, make pain medication dose changes, and make disposition decisions. This includes signing paperwork agreeing to leave the hospital against medical advice. That hadn't jibed with the captain of investigations for the Rochester police. Sherwin said it didn't make sense that Mayo staffers told police Alyssa had been making her own decisions, yet in the discharge note, they stated she wasn't capable of making her own decisions.  It didn't jibe with the experts, either.  They can't eat their cake and have it, too, said Feudtner, the medical ethicist at the University of Pennsylvania.Even if Alyssa truly did lack the capacity to make her own medical decisions, the experts had questions about Mayo's efforts to obtain emergency guardianship for Alyssa. Brian Smith, the Rochester police officer who responded to Mayo's 911 call the day Alyssa left Mayo, said a Mayo social worker told him she'd been working for a week or two to get a Minnesota county to take guardianship over Alyssa. The county would have guardianship over her and would make decisions for her, he told CNN. If that happened, Alyssa most likely would have stayed at Mayo, as she was already receiving treatment there, Smith said.  Bush-Seim, the Rochester police investigator, spoke with an official at one of the county adult protection agencies. She said it was also her understanding that Mayo wanted the county to take guardianship of Alyssa, or that perhaps Mayo itself wanted to directly take guardianship of her.  The legal experts said they were not surprised that Mayo was unable to get court orders for such guardianship arrangements. It's a drastic and highly unusual step for a county or a hospital to take guardianship over a patient, they said, rather than have a family member become the patient's surrogate decision-maker.  Robert McLeod, a Minneapolis attorney who helped the state legislature draft its guardianship laws, did not review the documents pertaining to Alyssa, as he did not want to comment on any specific case.  He said that before appointing a county or a hospital as a legal guardian, a judge would ask why a family member or close friend hadn't been selected as a surrogate.  From my 25 years of experience, a judge is going to say, 'why isn't the family the first and best choice here?' and it had better be a good reason, said McLeod, an adjunct professor at the Mitchell Hamline School of Law in Saint Paul, Minnesota. Other experts agreed. Saver, the professor at the University of North Carolina School of Law, said that in his four years working in the general counsel's office at the University of Chicago Hospitals and Health System, he doesn't once remember the hospital seeking guardianship for a patient who had a responsible relative or friend who could act as surrogates.  It's thought of as kind of the atom bomb remedy, Saver said. I'm a little flummoxed what to make of this. They had family members on the scene to look to. Alyssa said her biological father, Jason Gilderhus, told her that Mayo asked him to become her guardian. He did not become her guardian and did not respond to CNN's attempts to reach him.   Even if Mayo had concerns about Alyssa's mother and her biological father didn't work out, there were other friends and relatives to turn to, such as her stepfather, grandmother, great-grandmother, aunt or boyfriend's mother.  It's so baffling why they didn't try to designate a surrogate before trying to get a guardian, added Dr. R. Gregory Cochran, a physician and lawyer and associate director of the Health Policy and Law program at the University of California, Hastings College of the Law in San Francisco.Another feature of Alyssa's case also surprised the experts.  Caplan, the NYU bioethicist, said that in complicated and contentious cases like this one, doctors typically reach out to their hospital's ethics committee for help.   An ethics committee would listen to the doctors, other staff members, the patient and the family to try to resolve the conflict.   The family says no one ever mentioned an ethics committee to them, and there's no mention of an ethics committee consult in the discharge summary in Alyssa's medical records.   Annas, the lawyer at Boston University, agreed that an ethics committee consultation would have been an obvious and important way to help resolve the dispute before it spun out of control. Disputes between families and hospital staff happen all the time, and they can either escalate or de-escalate, Annas said. An ethics consult can help sort out the issues so they de-escalate.  The experts said they were disappointed that in Alyssa's case, the conflict escalated. I was shocked to see that parents had to pull a fast one to get their daughter out of the hospital, said Cochran, of the University of California.  I felt sad, said Feudtner, the ethicist at the University of Pennsylvania. Viewed in its entirety, this did not go well for anybody who was involved.Gaalswyk, the former Mayo board member, said he hopes the hospital learns something. I hope that someone somewhere will look at what happened in this unfortunate case and improve both our Mayo employee's actions and patient systems so that it not need happen again to any other patient at Mayo, he wrote a Mayo vice president after Alyssa left the hospital. The situation need not get out of hand like it did. While the details of Alyssa's case are extraordinary -- the Grandma Betty trick, the escape from the hospital with police on their heels -- the core of her story is not uncommon in many ways, according to patient advocates.  Dr. Julia Hallisy, founder of the Empowered Patient Coalition, says families often tell her that a hospital won't allow their loved one to transfer to another facility. Often, they're afraid to say anything publicly or on social media.    You sound like a crazy person -- that your family member was held hostage in an American hospital, she said. People can't believe that would happen. It's like the stuff of a science fiction story.  Kristen Spyker said it happened to her family.  When Spyker's son was born with a rare heart defect, she says she told doctors at the Ohio hospital where he was born that she wanted him to have a surgical repair at a hospital with a larger pediatric heart program.   She said the heart surgeon at the first hospital refused to send her son's medical records to other hospitals. She also says a surgeon resisted her efforts to transfer her newborn son to another hospital to get a second opinion on what surgery he should have for a rare heart defect.  The surgeon said, 'This is my patient. This is my show. I'm the boss, and I say what happens,'  she said.  She said a social worker, accompanied by hospital security guards, then came into her son's hospital room and said she was worried that Spyker had postpartum depression that was affecting her ability to make decisions for her son's care.  Spyker said the hospital discharged her son only after she threatened legal action. Her son then had a successful procedure at another hospital -- a different procedure than the one recommended by the first doctor. When she told her story on Facebook, Spyker said, other parents shared similar stories.  It was parent after parent after parent saying 'this happened to us,' she said. They had been so embarrassed to talk about it, but they felt freer when I said it happened to us.  Spyker was one of several people who spoke with Alyssa's parents last year while  their daughter was at Mayo.  In a statement to CNN, the American Hospital Association addressed conflicts between families and hospitals.  Communication between physicians and patients is extremely important in working to identify the best treatment, said Dr. Jay Bhatt, senior vice president and chief medical officer of the organization. Each patient is unique. It is for this reason that the majority of hospitals have patient advocates on staff to help patients and families navigate the care process. Hospitals recognize that patients are critical members of any care team and many are employing new strategies to ensure their voice and perspective is heard and accounted for.When hospitals and families get into intense conflict, Hallisy, a dentist who practices in San Francisco, says human emotions can run amok. She says she saw it happen when her daughter, Katherine, was being treated for cancer.  People think that doctors are immune to petty disagreements, but they're human beings, and sometimes ego and primitive emotions take over, she said.  She said that in Alyssa's case, she wonders whether a sensitive hospital staffer, perhaps a social worker, could have prevented the situation from becoming as contentious as it did.  She thinks back to her daughter, who died at age 10. She remembers the sadness and fear of having a very sick child, as well as the stress of taking care of her two other children and keeping her dental practice afloat while her daughter was in and out of the hospital. She thinks about how Alyssa was near death and how her parents had five younger children 130 miles away, as well as farms and a family business to run.  They were under incredible stress, Hallisy said. They'd almost lost a child, and they had other responsibilities, too. You would think that someone at Mayo would be trained to see that.  More than a year after leaving the Mayo Clinic, Alyssa, now 20, has belied her grim prognosis. Last year, she graduated from Martin County West High School, receiving a standing ovation from her class. She stayed out all night at her senior prom, where her classmates voted her prom queen. The local chapter of Future Farmers of America gave her the Star Farmer award. Her feeding tube came out a few months after she left Mayo, and she can eat and speak normally now. She can walk on her own without any assistance. Last summer, she presented her fantail pigeons at the Minnesota State Fair and competed in the poultry princess competition.  She finished up her physical and speech therapy in March, about a year after leaving Mayo. She'll be a freshman at Southwest Minnesota State University in September.Alyssa has not filed a lawsuit, but has engaged Martin, the lawyer who is also representing the Pelletier family.  Alyssa and her parents say they haven't recovered emotionally from what happened at Mayo. They say they still sometimes wake up in the middle of the night, panicked about what would have happened if they hadn't snuck her out of the hospital. I think she would be [at the hospital] and nobody would be able to see her, her stepfather said. They say Mayo still hasn't given them an explanation for why it was trying to arrange guardianship for Alyssa.   They think Mayo was trying to get guardianship in retaliation for questioning the staff, especially a senior physician.    I think that the doctor I made mad wanted to make sure that I paid for it no matter what, her mother said.   She's told that's a pretty hefty accusation.  We stand by it 100 percent, her stepfather said. "},

At the entrance to the world-renowned Mayo Clinic, the young woman's stepfather helps her out of a wheelchair and into the family car.Staff members come running toward him, yelling No! No! One of them grabs the young woman's arm.Get your hands off my daughter! her stepfather yells.The car speeds away, the stepfather and the patient inside, her mother at the wheel.Mayo security calls 911.We have had a patient abduction, the security officer tells police, according to a transcript of the call.The patient's name is Alyssa Gilderhus.   She and her family say she wasn't abducted from the Mayo Clinic in February 2017; rather, she escaped. They say the hospital was keeping her there against her will -- that Mayo medically kidnapped her.   Unhappy with the care she was receiving at Mayo, they say, they repeatedly asked for her to be transferred to another hospital. They say Mayo refused.   According to police, Mayo officials had a different plan for Alyssa: They had asked the county for assistance in gaining guardianship of Alyssa, who was an adult.A spokeswoman for the Mayo Clinic said hospital officials would be willing to answer CNN's questions if Alyssa signed a privacy release form giving them permission to discuss her case publicly with CNN. The spokeswoman, Ginger Plumbo, supplied that form to CNN. Alyssa signed the form, but Plumbo declined to answer CNN's questions on the record. Instead, she provided a statement, which said in part, We will not address these questionable allegations or publicly share the facts of this complex situation, because we do not believe it's in the best interest of the patient and the family. ... Our internal review determined that the care team's actions were true to Mayo Clinic's primary value that the patient's needs come first. We acted in a manner that honored that value for this patient and that also took into account the safety and well-being of the team caring for the patient.This story is based on interviews with Alyssa and members of her family, a family friend, law enforcement officials and a former member of a Mayo Clinic board, as well as documents including law enforcement records and Alyssa's medical records.   By everyone's account, this is an unfortunate and devastating story about a bitter clash that went out of control -- a clash between a Minnesota farm family and one of the world's most revered hospitals.   It's confusing to me why this went off the rails so horribly, said Richard Saver,\u202fa professor at the University of North Carolina School of Law, who at CNN's request reviewed medical and legal documents that the family and law enforcement officials provided to CNN.  \u202f Art Caplan,\u202fhead of the\u202fDivision of Medical Ethics at the New York University School of Medicine, also reviewed the documents, and he agrees.  This should never have happened, he said. This is a cautionary tale.\u202f   The relationship between Alyssa's family and the Mayo Clinic started off well.   On Christmas morning 2016, Alyssa settled in with a mug of hot chocolate to open her gifts. She was surrounded by her large family: her mother, Amber Engebretson, a stay-at-home mom; Duane Engebretson, her stepfather since she was 4 years old, who manages a construction company and the family's farms; and her five younger siblings, then 18 months to 11 years old.  They live in Sherburn, Minnesota, population just over 1,000 people, about 150 miles southwest of Minneapolis, on a farm with sheep, cows, horses and pigs.  Alyssa was thrilled with her first Christmas present: a pair of cowboy boots emblazoned with the emblem of the Future Farmers of America, her favorite club.   Then she went to the bathroom. Her parents heard screaming.  Mom, I need you! Alyssa yelled as she lay curled up on the floor, vomiting.  It was immediately obvious this was much more than just a stomach bug. Her left side was very weak, and she couldn't hear out of her left ear.  You could see looking at her that she was petrified, her stepfather said.   He called an ambulance. A local hospital determined that Alyssa, who'd always been healthy, had a ruptured : A blood vessel inside her brain had suddenly and unexpectedly burst.  Surgeons explained that her life was on the line. They drilled a hole in her skull to relieve the pressure on her brain. A nurse gave her parents a bag of Alyssa's hair, which had been shaved off for the operation. Some people liked to have it, she said.  Amber and Duane cried as they considered that this bag of hair -- their daughter's long, beautiful hair -- might be all they had left if she died.   They begged to have her sent to the Mayo Clinic. The main campus for the world-renowned medical center was 85 miles away in Rochester, Minnesota.  They're the best. People come from all over the world to go to Mayo, said Alyssa's mother, Amber Engebretson, who worked as a vehicle inspector for the Minnesota State Patrol before staying home to care for her family.   But Alyssa couldn't get to Mayo immediately. There was an ice storm. Ambulances couldn't drive, and helicopters couldn't fly.  The weather eventually broke, and about 7 p.m. -- about nine hours after the aneurysm -- Alyssa finally arrived by ambulance at Mayo headquarters in Rochester.  On Christmas night, surgeons gave her a 2% chance of living, her parents said. Doctors wrote in her medical record that her prognosis was grim.Her parents reached out on Facebook for prayers. They called their daughter the  #Christmasmiraclegirl.  Alyssa lived up to that name. She survived, thanks to four brain surgeries over the next month. Her doctors were ecstatic.   They were like, she's not supposed to be here. She beat the odds, her stepfather said.   Mayo neurosurgeons saved her life, added her mother. We'll be grateful to them forever.On January 30, Alyssa was transferred from the neurology unit to the rehabilitation unit.It should have been a happy turning point. But that's when the troubles began.  Although all had gone smoothly on the neurology floor, the family got into conflicts with the rehab staff almost immediately.  First, doctors there wanted to take Alyssa off oxycodone, a powerful opioid painkiller that the neurology doctors had prescribed for pain after surgery. Her most recent surgery -- the fourth in one month -- had been just a few days before.  She'd lay in bed with tears coming out of her eyes because she was in so much pain, her stepfather said.  Many medical authorities, including the , say opioids are critical for post-surgical pain management.  A week after Alyssa arrived on the rehabilitation floor, her mother shared her feelings on Facebook.  [Alyssa's] and my frustration level was high and it seems that they just don't listen sometimes, Amber wrote on February 7.More disputes arose. Her parents say their daughter's breathing tube was the wrong size, and they had to pester doctors to get it corrected. They also say the family -- not doctors -- discovered that she had a bladder infection. They say a social worker discussed private financial information within earshot of visiting friends and relatives.  Her parents asked for the social worker and a doctor to be replaced.  We just need someone who will at least listen to us and hear us, Amber wrote on her Facebook page on February 20.  Alyssa's parents say that at their request, they had a meeting with her care team on February 21.   I had two whiteboards filled up with questions left unanswered, tests left undone, and every other question we could think of, Amber wrote on her Facebook page that day.Amber says that at one point during that meeting, she told the staff she felt like they don't give a f***, later apologizing for her language. She also asked for a second doctor to stop taking care of their daughter. We took no crap and laid it all on the line. ... Because seriously what do we have to lose at this point, Amber wrote on Facebook that night. On February 22, the day after that meeting, Amber got into a disagreement with a nursing aide and asked to have her removed from her daughter's care team. She was the fourth staffer the family had asked to be replaced in just three weeks.  That afternoon, Amber says, she was scheduled to have a meeting with the social worker -- the same one she'd asked to leave her daughter's care. Amber had requested the meeting, and she says that as she approached the office at the appointed time, a man she'd never seen was standing in the office doorway. She said he saw her coming and went into the office and shut the door.  Amber listened through the door. She says that as she suspected, the man and the social worker were talking about her family.  I proceeded to open the door and say, 'Since you're talking about my family, I think it's only appropriate that I would be here also, to be included in the conversation,'  she remembers.  She says the man puffed out his chest and stepped toward her, and she took a backward step into the hall. The man, who Amber later learned was a physician, demanded that she leave.  She says the man told her, I run this whole rehab unit. Do you understand me?  Amber describes the doctor as intensely aggressive.  She replied to him, she says, with similar aggression and frustration: I need to talk to you. Do you understand me? The doctor walked away. CNN reached out to this doctor and other staff members involved in Alyssa's care but did not receive responses.  About an hour later, Alyssa's parents say, the same doctor, the social worker and a nurse approached the family. They were accompanied by three security guards.  [The doctor] said to me, 'You are not allowed to participate in Alyssa's care. You are not allowed on Mayo property. You will be escorted off the premises right now,'  Amber remembers.  Amber and Duane say they asked why Amber was being kicked out but did not receive an answer.  Later, a social worker would tell police that Amber interrupted a meeting because Amber was upset over the care Alyssa was receiving. Due to that incident, Amber was escorted off of [Mayo] property.According to Alyssa's parents, the doctor told Duane that he could stay but that he would not be allowed to have any involvement in his stepdaughter's care.  The couple say they asked the doctor whether they could speak with a patient advocate.  He said, 'There is no patient advocate,' and walked away, Amber said.  When asked about Amber's dismissal from the hospital, Mayo spokeswoman Plumbo sent CNN a statement.  Our care teams act in the best interests of our patients.\u202fAs a general practice, this includes sharing information with family members and facilitating family visits and interactions with patients and their care providers when the patient is in our care. However, in situations where care may be compromised or the safety and security of our staff are potentially at risk, the family members' ability to be present in the hospital may be restricted.Plumbo did not elaborate on whether or how Amber compromised her daughter's care or placed staff at risk.  We would never compromise her care, Amber said. She's our daughter. We love her.  She also says she never put staff members at risk. We would never do that -- ever, she said. On February 23, the day after Amber was kicked out, she went on Facebook.   PRAYER WARRIORS UNITE!!!! We need your help. ... Please READ THIS AND SHARE THIS POST in hopes it reaches the people or person who can help us, she wrote.I HAVE BEEN TOLD I AM NOT ALLOWED IN ALYSSA'S ROOM AND NO ONE IS ALLOWED TO HAVE ANY SAY OR PARTICIPATE IN HER [CARE]. ... I AM NOT ALLOWED TO SEE HER!! We have been given no reason why, no paperwork, and no explanations, she continued. I never imagined something like this could happen in our world and a very hard situation already has been made even harder!!The response from one Facebook user led the family to conclude that they needed to get Alyssa out of Mayo, and fast.   Alyssa, who was legally an adult during her entire hospitalization, says that around this time, she started asking doctors and nurses to transfer her to another facility.  She says she never received a response.   They were cruel to me, Alyssa said, adding that she wanted to get out of Mayo as bad as possible.   On February 23, three weeks into her daughter's stay in rehab, Amber complained on Facebook, tagging Mayo.   They refuse to let her go. ... We cannot transfer [Alyssa] out or get her discharged, she wrote. No one has any say in [Alyssa's care] and she is basically a prisoner of Mayo.Alyssa's stepfather and grandmother say they also asked to have her transferred out of Mayo.  I asked two to three times a day, and it would go nowhere, Duane said.   Duane said, 'This is ridiculous. We don't want her here; Alyssa doesn't want to be here; she doesn't feel safe here,'  her grandmother Aimee Olson remembers. But there was no response.  Duane says he tried to talk to a senior doctor on the rehab staff about a transfer. It was the same doctor who had asked his wife to leave the hospital.   He said 'I have nothing to say to you. This is a legal problem,'  Duane remembers. I even asked him, 'can I speak to your supervisor, your boss,' and his exact words were 'I run this whole floor,' and [he] turned around and walked out of the room, and that was it.'  Duane says he called the Mayo Patient Experience office and in a 45-minute phone call described the family's grievances. He said the patient experience specialist told him he would be back in touch after getting Mayo's side of the story.    Olson, Alyssa's grandmother and Amber's mother, said she also tried to speak with the senior doctor but was told he wasn't available.  She was truly being held captive, Olson said. I would never believe a hospital could do that -- never in my wildest dreams.  The family and a friend say they were instructed by Mayo staff not to talk to Alyssa about her mother.  Two nurses were assigned to be with Alyssa, and they kept careful watch, according to visitors.  It was like they were watching every move you made, said Joy Schmitt, Alyssa's boyfriend's mother, who visited frequently after Amber was asked to leave the hospital.  On February 21, the day before her mother was kicked out of the hospital, a Mayo psychiatrist examined Alyssa and found that she lacked the capacity to make her own medical decisions, according to a summary of her care that her doctors wrote after she left Mayo.Around this time, a hospital social worker went to adult protection services in two counties to try to get those authorities to get guardianship over Alyssa, according to the police. If they had succeeded, she would have become a ward of the state.Alyssa and her family say that they weren't told any of this as it was happening but that around this time, they started to feel that Mayo was isolating Alyssa.  On February 26, staffers confiscated Alyssa's cell phone, laptop and tablet after finding that she'd made a video for her mother, according to Alyssa and her family. They say Alyssa's visitors were also banned from bringing their devices into the hospital.  The same day, Mayo staffers said no one would be allowed to stay overnight with Alyssa, according to Duane and Amber's sister, April Chance, who attended a meeting with Alyssa's care team.   Duane says he asked the staff to reconsider. He said his stepdaughter had never spent the night alone in the hospital. But he says they refused.   The doctors said they were doing this for Alyssa's own benefit, Duane said.  The family says the doctors also told them that visitors would no longer be allowed to attend Alyssa's treatment sessions, such as physical and occupational therapy.   I said, 'We're her cheerleaders. We cheer her on,'  her aunt remembers. And they said 'No, you're impeding her care.'    She said the staff didn't elaborate on how they were impeding her care.  They were restricting us little by little from even being with Alyssa. They were taking over our daughter, Duane said.   Mayo also pushed back Alyssa's discharge date, which was supposed to be February 27.  Meanwhile, her mother's following was growing on Facebook, with many users posting angry messages that tagged Mayo.   One woman sent Amber links to stories about a teenager named Justina Pelletier.   Articles in  and elsewhere described how in 2013, Pelletier, then 14 years old, was placed in state custody for nearly 16 months after Boston Children's Hospital accused her parents of interfering in her care. She spent much of that time in a psychiatric ward. Amber says she spoke on the phone with Justina's parents, Linda and Lou Pelletier. She says they warned her there would be signs that the hospital was seeking guardianship for their daughter. They would keep a tight watch over her and limit her communications with her family.   Through their lawyer, John T. Martin, the Pelletiers confirmed that they had conversations with Amber.   A spokeswoman for Boston Children's Hospital told CNN that the hospital is committed to the best interest of our patients' health and well-being and declined to discuss the specifics of the case.  Amber sent a text to the woman who'd sent her the news articles. OMG I am SICK. This is what is happening, Amber wrote. It rings lots and lots of bells. ... Omg ... I am so scared.  Alyssa's parents reached out to a friend of a friend for help: Mark Gaalswyk, who at the time was a member of the board of directors for the Mayo Clinic Health System in Fairmont, Minnesota.  Gaalswyk emailed a Mayo Clinic vice president. He informed her of the situation and explained that CNN had contacted the family.    Could you please please do what you can to get your arms around the [situation] immediately?! he wrote. Please get to the bottom of this quickly before it blows up even more.But Gaalswyk's pull wasn't enough. He says Mayo treated Alyssa terribly.I'm probably the most pro-Mayo person who has walked the face of this earth, said Gaalswyk, who left the board January 1. But this was a mess.He said he thinks Amber probably used words she shouldn't have with hospital staff. I'm not saying that Amber is 100 percent in the right, he added, but I know what Mayo did is not OK at all.In its statement to CNN, the Mayo spokeswoman said that Mayo Clinic is committed to the safety and wellbeing of all the patients we treat.Feeling like they were running out of options, Alyssa's parents then enlisted the help of Karie Rego, an attorney and patient advocate they'd met on Facebook.  On February 27, Rego spoke on the phone with Joshua Murphy, Mayo's chief legal officer, and faxed him a letter urging Mayo to transfer Alyssa to another facility.  Given what has happened here, an expedited transfer this coming week would be best for everyone, she wrote.Rego says an attorney in Murphy's office called her later. She says that he told her he  couldn't speak with her and that she never heard anything more from Mayo's legal department.   That night, Alyssa's parents thought about Justina Pelletier and the 16 months she spent in state custody. They went online and printed a form for Alyssa to sign, saying she was leaving the hospital against medical advice. But her parents didn't know how they would get her out. Two nurses were assigned to keep watch over her at all times. They started to hatch a plan to get her out of Mayo the very next day."},
{"title": "From 'screw you' Aetna to Sweet 16, teen celebrates her surgery -- and new life", "cate": "health", "content": "Cara Pressman raises her hands in triumph. The crowd claps in unison, and a DJ cranks up the music. The banquet hall on the banks of the Hudson pulsates as nine of Cara's best friends lead a procession to the dance floor. It's the start of her Sweet 16 birthday party -- a celebration not just of her big day but of all that has happened in the past year. A way for friends and family to express their love. Cara became a viral sensation months ago after the teen with a seizure disorder delivered a blunt message to her insurer. Her two words for Aetna -- screw you -- expressed the anger she felt at being denied a minimally invasive brain surgery that promised to end her seizures. Her story, , triggered a massive uproar, and Aetna eventually approved the procedure.This Saturday evening, amid the cheers of her closest friends, Cara radiates on stage beneath strings of white flashing lights. Then someone shouts, and the dance floor clears. Everyone rushes outside. It's as if Mother Nature has joined the party: A rainbow stretches from the Hudson River high into the heavens. Cara launches her head back and strikes an array of poses as people take photos. That's what's important in life -- miracles, right? her mother, Julie Pressman, says, pointing to the sky. I can finally exhale.Her father, Rob, says it's like a unicorn coming down.She's been so happy since the operation, he says. We're looking forward to a great year.It's a moment the family thought might never come. Cara's mother became a fierce champion for her youngest daughter, determined that Cara would get the surgery her doctors believed could stop her seizures. Each time they struck, her body would grow cold and shake. She'd zone out anywhere from 20 seconds to two minutes, typically still aware of what was going on around her. She had seizures on the soccer field, during softball games, on stage during plays, in the classroom. Most anywhere.Her doctors last year recommended Cara for laser ablation surgery, a minimally invasive procedure in which a thin laser is used to heat and destroy lesions in the brain where the seizures originate. It's cutting-edge work, performed through an eighth-inch hole in the skull. Neurosurgeons believe it to be more precise and less invasive than traditional open brain surgery, in which a two-inch hole is cut in the skull or, in some cases, the entire skull cap is removed. Yet the nation's third-largest insurance company overruled her treating physicians. In denying her coverage, Aetna said it considered laser ablation surgery experimental and investigational for the treatment of epilepsy because the effectiveness of this approach has not been established.Clinical studies have not proven that this procedures [sic] effective for treatment of the member's condition, Aetna said.When first approached for comment by CNN late last year, the insurance giant stood by its denial.In response, Cara : Considering they're denying me getting surgery and stopping this thing that's wrong with my brain, I would probably just say, 'screw you.' From there, the story took off. The hashtags and  were shared across Twitter. Her grandmother made T-shirts for family members for Christmas that read I'm on Cara's team on the front; on the back, the message said #SYA (short for ).Behind the scenes, neurologists and neurosurgeons reached out to the family, offering support. But none was more powerful than Mark Solazzo, the executive vice president and chief operating officer of , New York's largest health care provider.The hospital executive was so moved by Cara's story he told the family: This is the last day you're going to fight Aetna on your own. Solazzo is passionate on this issue: Insurance denials for what Northwell deems medically necessary procedures have swelled the past two years, with the health provider saying it lost $150 million in justifiable reimbursements at a time when insurance companies have been setting record profits.The Northwell executive set in motion a chain of events. He tapped Dr. Ashesh Dinesh Mehta, the director of Northwell's epilepsy surgery, to handle Cara's case and even offered the surgery for free if Aetna still refused to cover it.I was happy to do that, Mehta said.Cara underwent a series of tests this spring with her new team at Northwell. Mehta said her case was complex because the focal point of her seizures was fairly deep in her brain behind her temple. To perform an open brain surgery, he said, he would need to dissect a portion of her brain to get to the spot. As a result, Mehta said, her team agreed with her previous doctors that laser ablation was the route to go.We did our due diligence, and we did determine that this would be the best way to treat her epilepsy, he told CNN.Along the way, Aetna had a change of heart. In April, the insurer notified the family it would cover the surgery: Coverage for this service has been approved, subject to the requirements in this letter.There was no explanation. No apology. Just an approval with full coverage.Pressed by CNN for answers, Aetna said the approval came after her doctors made a new request for laser ablation surgery. Based on recently published clinical evidence, the procedure was approved.Aetna went on to say it recently updated  seeking laser ablation. Related, in July 2018 we made updates to our epilepsy surgery clinical policies based on recently-published data, Aetna said. The new guidelines cover laser ablation surgery if certain criteria are met.As shared in December, we constantly evaluate new published and peer-reviewed studies as well as additional evidence when developing our clinical policies, and will continue to do so.Mehta gave all the credit to the diminutive teen with the powerful voice: She really advocated for herself, and it worked out for her. Whatever happened, it got her the appropriate treatment. I've got to hand it to her.Northwell's Solazzo added, Cara has been an inspiration to all those who have had the privilege of caring for her. Her advocacy and courage will hopefully clear the way for other epilepsy patients who could benefit from this surgery.The day of the surgery, July 25, was filled with nerves and excitement. Cara's parents and older sister, Lindsey, crowded her hospital room before the operation. They gabbed about trivial, everyday stuff, as families often do.But make no mistake. The importance of the day weighed on everyone. Cara told staff at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset she had never been more excited for anything in my life. Her first grand mal seizure, when she fell to the floor and shook, came at the age of 9, but she remembers having smaller aura seizures, when she would space out for brief spells, as far back as kindergarten. She can have five seizures in a day, sometimes as many as 30.It's been really, really difficult to live with, she said. As she was wheeled off to the operating room, Dad wrapped his arms around Lindsey and held her, reassuring her that Cara would be OK. Cara had waited until summer to undergo the surgery. That way, she could adjust to any changes in her brain activity before the new school year started. Laser ablation is still emerging in the care of epilepsy patients, and Cara's mother said she hopes her daughter can serve as an example for other teens who qualify for laser surgery and are afraid of open brain surgery, known as a This really gives people hope who are young and dealing with this -- that they can go forward early on in life and get this procedure done, she says.In the operating room, the hourlong procedure went quite well, Mehta said. Everything went as planned. There are only about 40 to 50 centers around the nation, Mehta said, where laser ablation surgeries are performed, with the technique becoming more popular in recent years. Mehta said existing data show about a 50% seizure-free rate for those who undergo laser ablation, compared to about 70% who undergo traditional open brain surgeries.A comprehensive study is underway to better define its efficacy. But Mehta said he has had better success than the national average: My results are about as good as the open temporal lobectomy.The laser surgery is more appealing to patients and parents, he says, because open surgery can be so daunting. Laser surgery is less invasive, requires less time in the hospital and has a quicker recovery, Mehta said.Patients can suffer short-term memory loss, especially forgetting names of people they meet. It's not usually something that is devastating, especially when you're younger, he says. Given that she's young, we believe that her brain is going to be more able to adapt.Cara had one grand mal seizure in the days after the surgery, but she'd forgotten to take her anti-seizure medicine the day before. Mehta also says it's not unusual for patients to have seizures in the week or two right after surgery.Based on her recovery three weeks after surgery, he believes Cara has a 60% to 80% chance of being seizure-free. The benchmark will be a year from now. The big question is whether she will have one or two seizures a year or whether she has no seizures, Mehta says. We want no seizures.I'm keeping my fingers crossed.At her birthday party, the new Cara is on full display. She dances. She laughs. She commands the crowd.Her sister marvels at her transformation. She is just flourishing, Lindsey says. I've never seen her so vibrant and so open with herself.Cara says it's been weird ever since her surgery because I feel so much better. It's also a bit of an adjustment to think she could actually be seizure-free.It kind of feels like it's a little bit of a dream, but I also know it's real.On stage, Cara honors 16 of the closest people in her life, and each helps light an individual candle. She begins with her father: One of the funniest people I know.There's the uncle who is one of the biggest weirdos I know, the friend who always knows when to cheer me up and the one who always has a smile on her face that never seems to leave. She saves the 16th candle for her mom. Cara praises her as a triathlete and marathon runner, and thanks her for planning the entire party. She was there for me every single time I was in the hospital -- literally the best, Cara says. Mom, please come up and light the final candle!As the Beatles' Here Comes the Sun echoes across the room, Mom rushes to hug her daughter. As the two embrace, George Harrison's voice sings:"},
{"title": "While America wages war on opioids, meth makes its comeback", "cate": "health", "content": "For Capt. Mark Wollmershauser Jr. and the Tulsa Police Department, the late-2000s and early 2010s were an extremely dangerous time. In Oklahoma, a state that is no stranger to the scourge of methamphetamine addiction, those years were the heyday of the shake and bake method -- a rudimentary way of making meth using just cold medicine, some toxic chemicals and an empty two-liter bottle.The technique is simple enough that many addicts can cook their own meth, but with one tiny misstep, the chemical reaction that occurs inside .By 2011, Wollmershauser and his narcotics unit were finding and dismantling hundreds of these vessels in meth labs around the city. People were not just burning themselves while cooking meth but were causing damage to other residents that had nothing to do with methamphetamine, he said. It was a really horrible time.When  -- an allergy drug used in making meth -- the proliferation of these mobile labs waned. After responding to a high of 431 meth labs in 2011, his department encountered just 19 last year.But Wollmershauser said that didn't spell the end of Tulsa's meth problem. In fact, officials across the state say they are seizing meth that is purer, cheaper and in greater quantities than ever before, with most of it coming from south of the border.And while much of America is focused on combating the devastating impacts of opioid addiction, some states like Oklahoma are struggling to fight a new battle against an old foe.Richard Salter has been with the Drug Enforcement Administration for 27 years, most recently as the special agent in charge for the state of Oklahoma.He said the meth problem in Oklahoma is getting worse, and points to Mexican cartels -- in particular, the powerful Sinaloa cartel -- as the reason.As it became more difficult and dangerous to produce meth in the United States, cartels recognized an opportunity to fill the void.They came in with much purer, much cheaper meth and just flooded this region of the country, Salter said.Salter said in 2012, the DEA was buying meth undercover off the streets for $1,100 an ounce. Today, his agents are regularly getting ounces for just $250 to $450.That's as cheap as I have ever seen methamphetamine my entire career, he said.The reason for the drop in prices is the scale of production that the Mexican cartels have achieved. Whereas shake and bake labs could turn out lots of small batches, so-called superlabs in Mexico produce hundreds of pounds daily.Salter said most of the meth his agents seize first comes across the US-Mexico border in California or Arizona, before making its way through the interstate highway system and temporary stash houses on its way to Oklahoma.Along the border, officials with US Customs and Border Protection also report a steep increase in the amount of meth they are seizing.Anne Maricich, deputy director of field operations for the agency's San Diego ports of entry, said her field office has seen a 50% increase in the amount of meth seized compared to this time last year.The other hard narcotics like cocaine, heroin and fentanyl, we see them -- they're prevalent at our border crossings, but nowhere near the quantities that we see of meth, she said.On the streets of Oklahoma, this influx of cheap and powerful meth has had deadly consequences.The number of lethal meth overdoses in the state has more than doubled in recent years, rising from 140 in 2012 to 335 deaths in 2016. In 2017, there were 327 meth overdose deaths, but that tally is incomplete and the actual number is likely higher, according to Mark Woodward, spokesman with the Oklahoma Bureau of Narcotics.There's so much attention -- not just in Oklahoma, but nationwide -- on the opioid crisis, said Woodward. But our single most deadly individual drug is methamphetamine.Perhaps no city has been hit harder by this latest meth epidemic than Tulsa.In just the first six months of 2018, Wollmershauser said his Special Investigations Division has already surpassed the amount of meth they seized in all of 2017 by 30 pounds. He can't explain why the problem is more severe here than in other parts of the state, but he doesn't think incarceration is the solution. Wollmershauser said his department is trying to use more front end diversion tactics to help addicts get treatment without getting the criminal justice system involved, while also aggressively pursuing the cartels and other large-scale distributors.While the amount of meth his officers has seized has risen, he said his department is on track to reduce the number of arrests by 40% this year. I think we're definitely targeting the right folks that are taking advantage of our city and citizens, but the addiction is strong and it's difficult, Wollmershauser said.Lindsay McAteer's struggles with anxiety and depression led her to self-medicate as a teenager.At age 14, her boyfriend at the time introduced her to meth. I immediately liked it, McAteer said. It gave me a false sense of identity and a false sense of accomplishment. It was the beginning of a 20-year struggle with the drug that nearly ended with a life sentence.After using meth for several years, she said she stopped for a brief period, but after she was laid off from work and had her house foreclosed on, her addiction spiraled out of control.I had nothing, McAteer said. I was losing everything, and meth was able to make me feel like everything was OK, despite the fact that nothing was OK.In addition to using meth, McAteer began selling the drug. She was eventually arrested for trafficking and found herself staring at a possible sentence of 12 years to life.Mass incarceration is also an issue in Oklahoma -- particularly among women -- and , according to analysis by . The state has the , with 149 out of every 100,000 women locked up, more than double the national average. But even for those like McAteer who face time in prison, there are sometimes alternatives to a life behind bars. , or WIR, is an intensive program for women who are looking at lengthy sentences for drug offenses in Tulsa County.With the door of a prison cell the only other option that was open to her, McAteer entered WIR in August 2014.Mimi Tarrasch, the executive senior director for WIR, said that many of the program's participants are multi-substance users, but at least 60% have seen their addictions lead them to meth.Early on, because it's a stimulant, they feel wonderful and it makes them productive and motivated, said Roxanne Hinther, clinical director for WIR. But ultimately, they can't take care of their children and they lose everything they have.Tarrasch said that most of the women in her program have been battling addiction for 13 to 15 years, which takes a huge toll on their health and wellness, and that of their family. Many have also experienced traumatic events, from childhood abuse to sexual assaults and domestic violence.Using a range of treatments, training and education, the program gives women who would be spending time behind bars a second chance at a productive and fulfilling life.McAteer graduated from WIR in 2016 and has now been in active recovery for more than four years. Today, she works as a housing compliance specialist for the Mental Health Association Oklahoma.Since Women in Recovery began in 2009, 390 women have graduated, with 6.7% of graduates relapsing or falling back into criminal activity.I can say that recovery is definitely possible, and I can say that treatment is the answer versus punishment, McAteer said. It's not foolproof -- I can't say that everyone is able to use this [program] the way it's designed to work, but the vast majority of us do."},
{"title": "Slow down and live long with the ancient practice of qigong", "cate": "health", "content": "Among the skyscrapers of Hong Kong, eight senior citizens gather at the Happy Valley Recreation grounds in the Wan Chai district. It's time for their weekly class in qigong, an ancient Chinese mind-body practice similar to tai chi.It's summer on the island, and at 8:30 in the morning, the temperature is already 80 degrees Fahrenheit, with an unforgiving level of humidity. But the hot weather does not deter qigong Master Joe Lok's students; they believe wholeheartedly in the positive effects the practice has on their health.  The word qigong is a combination of qi, meaning energy, and gong, which loosely translates as an accomplishment or practice, explained Lok, who has been practicing qigong for nearly 30 years. It is the accomplishment or practice of energy and involves becoming aware of your breathing, sensing the energy within you and then following a series of slow, coordinated movements. Movement, meditation and controlled breathing are the staples of every qigong session, with the ultimate focus being holistic well-being. Lok explains that in order to do qigong ... we have to be pretend to be empty, so the first thing to empty is the mind, so we try not to think of anything and only listen to our breathing, relax all the strength and relax the mind, so it's some kind of meditation.to improve stress, anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. Experts believe it goes hand-in-hand with healthy habits that can improve our longevity. As a result, qigong itself is a health practice, Lok said.For Lok, it is vital that all his students experience qi before they begin any movements. He practices Taoist qigong, which has a strong connection with nature, he explained. In his class, he says that you can start to experience the qi by simply holding a specific posture. Your feet should be between hip and shoulder distance apart and your toes turned out slightly. From here, Lok encourages you to breathe deeply and straighten the curve in your lower spine by moving your hips slightly forward. With your hands hanging loosely, relax your body so you don't feel any pressure or tension on your joints. Lok directs his students to focus and straighten their fingertips slightly with their hands in front of their stomachs and pointing at an angle down to the ground. He then asks his students whether they can sense qi-- a warm feeling or  feeling of life in their fingertips, often causing a tingling sensation. Once his students all feel the it, the movement routine can begin. He warns that you can easily wave your hands around without really experiencing qi, and that would completely defeat the purpose of his practice. The goal of the movement is to clear blockages, release pain and refresh the body and mind.The movements in qigong are very slow. Students raise their arms over their heads, rotate their wrists, lower their arms and then make circular motions with their hands. Lok says that as soon as you get into it, the qi begins to flow.Emotions are also calmed, and people tend to live happier, Lok believes. In a day and age when wellness is prioritized and dozens of wellness practices sprout daily, with elements of the ancient practice of qigong forming the basis for many of them and studies highlighting the benefits.Cecilia Chan, chair of the Department of Social Work and Social Administration at the University of Hong Kong, has been studying the effects of qigong for years. Her aim is simple: to demystify the seemingly inexplicable benefits.  There are a lot of misconceptions about qigong, said Chan, whose team studies internal qigong, or exercise qigong -- a simple set of movements in which no energy is given to participants through a qigong master; instead, the participants use their own energy to do the movements, similar to other movement practices, like yoga. They do not explore external qigong, in which many believe that a qigong master can give you healing energy through hand gestures. Chan believes that qigong can be beneficial to health, especially for those with chronic fatigue syndrome. Her team conducted  with chronic fatigue in 2012, concluding that qigong may improve chronic fatigue symptoms and mental functioning.They conductedto explore whether qigong can reduce depression among women with chronic fatigue. From our study, we found that a lot of people after practicing qigong ... become more positive, Chan said. They become less indulged in their suffering, and they leave the victim's role more readily. She likens qigong to other mind-body practices like yoga and adds that it teaches a philosophy of letting go, helping those who practice it to embrace a philosophy of let it be ... and be happy with yourself.Researchers at Harvard University have also been exploring the heath aspects of qigong, with  finding that its practice can help with motor function and depression for individuals with Parkinson's disease. Lok, however, needs no convincing that qigong works on many levels. He witnesses the healing benefits all around him in class. There's evidence everywhere that it benefits life in general, he said. If you have a little time, try qigong. Perhaps you will see the miracle in the qigong, but if you don't try it, there's no chance. ... Find a teacher near you or otherwise go online and start doing something. It's very easy, and the benefit is ever so great."},
{"title": "Claire Wineland, inspirational speaker and social media star, dies one week after lung transplant", "cate": "health", "content": "Cystic fibrosis did not define Claire Wineland. She did.No matter the obstacles placed in front of her, of which there were many, she refused to be pitied and was determined to live a life that mattered. She inspired countless people, invited -- no, demanded -- honest talk about illness and mortality, and brightened the worlds of those she touched with her smile, spunk and spirit.On Sunday evening, after being taken off life support and using the newly transplanted lungs she received just one week earlier, Claire took her last breath. The cause of death was a massive stroke she suffered soon after the transplant surgery. She was 21.A quarter of Claire's life was spent in the hospital. The medical team that tended to her became family. She played hide-and-seek with nurses and left explosions of glitter in her wake. She watched one of her doctors squirm as he gave her the safe-sex talk. She took great care to decorate her hospital room so it felt and looked like home.Her parents, Melissa Nordquist Yeager and John Wineland, split up when Claire was 3, but they remained friends and partners in her care.Her father credits Claire with teaching him to not be afraid of what hasn't happened yet and to learn to love what is.Yeager, who lost and quit jobs as hospital stays dictated, always marveled at her daughter's aura and her ability to lift up those around her.In 2017, Yeager recalled a conversation with Claire about death. At one point, Claire looked at her mom and said, After you die, you're closer to everyone you love because you're part of everything, Yeager remembered.These words were a gift, a reminder that Claire would remain with her always, even after she was gone.More than 30,000 people in the United States, more than 70,000 worldwide, have cystic fibrosis, according to the . The median survival age is 40, the foundation reports, which is a great improvement from the 1950s, when surviving long enough to attend elementary school was rare.The genetic and progressive disease creates an overabundance of mucus, which traps infections and blocks airways in the lungs. It also complicates digestion, affects the pancreas and other organs and, eventually, leads to respiratory failure.There is no cure, but dutiful breathing treatments -- which eat up hours each day -- can help with symptoms and complications. A double-lung transplant, when successful, can add years to a patient's life.Claire's parents learned to trust their independent and strong-willed daughter. When it came to her care, she knew her body best -- what worked for her, what didn't and how far she was willing to go.So when she became a legal adult and told them she had no intention of getting a double-lung transplant, they had to accept her decision, even if it pained them.I had to be honest, she once explained. It's not for me and never has been.Claire took the gift of life and her health seriously, but she didn't take herself too seriously. She once escaped from the hospital so she could attend a Bernie Sanders rally. She laughed at the absurdities that often swirled around her, including those moments in the produce aisle at Whole Foods when shoppers would prescribe her unsolicited cures, telling her to eat more pineapple or that a mushroom cleanse would take care of everything.She was of the mind that she would leave this world with the body she came in with. She'd travel, answer calls for speaking engagements and put energy into , which she set up at age 13 after coming out of a 16-day medically induced coma. She'd work on a book -- promising it wouldn't be another happy sick person book -- and appreciate the small things like swims in the ocean for as long as she was able.At  she gave last year, Claire made a point of saying how cystic fibrosis helped give her a quality of life.Life isn't just about being happy. ... It's not about how you feel second to second, she said. It's about what you're making of your life and whether you can find a deep pride in who you are and what you've given. Claire had a change of heart about transplant earlier this year, prompted by a steep decline in her health that robbed her of the energy and ability to do what gave her joy and purpose. She wasn't done contributing. It was a welcome, albeit terrifying, development for those who loved her.To get on the list for new lungs, she had to be sick enough to need them, yet strong enough to withstand the surgery and recovery. Some people worried that she'd waited too long and wouldn't be given the chance at continued life.But Claire took on the evaluation process to get on the list with laser focus. She sat in an educational meeting at UC San Diego Health's transplant center and diligently took notes. Revealed on her left ankle was a tattoo: the thumbs-up Don't Panic logo from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.She listened to the risks and the long list of side effects and emerged unfazed.None of it spooked me, Claire said afterward. Now that I'm looking at it as something I have to do ... I'm willing to deal with anything.In late May, she made the list and shared the exciting news with her social media followers who dot the globe. But then, a mix of health and life complications took a toll and knocked her off the list, temporarily. By mid-August, she was back on and feeling ready.She'd worked hard to get there, was focused on her self-care and getting stronger. She joked that the squats she was doing, upon doctor's orders, would help get her more than lungs. She'd also get a butt.  She knew that the call could come at any minute, and on August 26, it did.It's a GO!!! she posted on Twitter, not long before she was wheeled into the operating room in San Diego. See y'all on [the] other side.The nine-hour surgery went well, and her mother reported that the lungs were working great. Yeager posted a video of herself doing a happy dance with friends in the waiting room. But not long after the successful surgery, hope turned to fear. Claire suffered a stroke when a blood clot cut off blood flow to the right side of her brain. She never emerged from her medically induced coma. Despite emergency surgeries, and what her mother described as Herculean efforts to try to save her, the daughter she knew was gone. Given the severity of the stroke and Claire's advance directive, it became clear that it was time to let her go. She passed away peacefully, with her parents by her side. They saw her into this world for her first breath and were with her for her last, Laura McHolm, the board chair for Claire's foundation, wrote in a Facebook post.Less than 3% of lung transplant recipients have a stroke between the surgery and hospital discharge, according to the , which operates the nation's organ transplant system.Claire, who understood the importance of organ donation, was a donor herself. On Monday afternoon, her mother received word that Claire had already made a difference. Claire was able to save the life of two people, her right kidney was transplanted to a 44 year old woman in San Diego, and her left kidney was transplanted to a 55 year old male in Northern California. Also, Claire's corneas and tissue was recovered and she will be able to enhance the life of up to 50 people, a family services specialist wrote to Yeager in an email message. Claire's gift is huge, I want your family to know that your daughter is a hero.The family intends to honor her memory by continuing to advance , which she established to financially support others affected by her lifelong disease. In one of the last videos Claire posted, she went where she hadn't before.A self-described goofball, she usually engaged people with humor and optimism. This time, she was raw and allowed herself to cry. As she faced the prospect of getting a double-lung transplant, she understood how desperate she was to live -- and give -- more.It hurts everything inside of me to make this video, she said into the camera. I didn't realize how much I didn't expect to live this long. I didn't expect to have a chance. ... The years of telling myself I can do it on my own are over.She had plenty of emotional support, but she worried what transplant surgery might mean for her future and her parents' future if it didn't go well. What if they poured everything into her transplant, and she didn't make it or was not able to work again, she explained later. She needed financial help. By asking for it, she said, she could relax and get in the headspace for whatever would come next.Before signing off, Claire implored viewers to do one thing.Go enjoy your life. Really. I mean that seriously, she said with her signature smile and laugh, her eyes not yet dry. Go enjoy it, 'cause there are people fighting like hell for it."},
{"title": "'Amazing' treatment helps paralyzed people walk again", "cate": "health", "content": "Kelly Thomas inches across the soft grass, using a walker to navigate her way. Each step is exhilarating and exhausting. She pauses amid the 90-degree Florida heat and smiles. It only takes a little bit of try -- and by a little, I mean a lot, she says.Thomas, 24, is one of three paralyzed patients who can now walk again, thanks to a stimulation device implanted in her lower back coupled with intense physical therapy. News of the patients' progress -- considered an important medical advancement -- was published in separate studies in two scientific journals on Monday. On a recent sunny day, Thomas returned to the spot that took so much from her on July 19, 2014. It's where the truck she was driving came to a halt after flipping four times around a bend on Halls River Road and smashing into a tree. Her body was motionless, hanging halfway out of the mangled wreckage. She was blue and getting cold.She has driven past the scene of the crash many times since then to try to jar her memory. To help remember what happened that night. To piece together the moment that changed everything. Nothing seems to work.Visiting this time, she walks toward the tree, talking to her legs to motivate them to keep moving. One foot in front of the other, she says. Slowly but surely.At 5 feet, 1 inch tall, she is a spitfire of inspiration. Her grit shows immediately, not just from when she walks, but also when she talks.  Paralysis isn't in my dictionary. Don't call me handicapped, because I'm not.Thank God, I was raised cowboy tough.It takes several minutes for her to walk the 40 feet from her car to the tree. Every step is worth it: Today is about triumph rather than a search for lost memories. I tell you what, she says. It does feel good to be standing where I thought my life ended.She woke in a hospital a couple of weeks after the accident, with tubes and wires seemingly hooked up to everything. At 19, she was paralyzed from the chest down.She told her neurosurgeon she would walk again, no matter how slim the odds. He left the room and told her mother not to go chasing something that's never going to happen.The journey has been in no way easy. There were tears and screaming fits. In moments of desperation, she would say to God, I don't know why this has happened, but if you can help me to understand this, it might make it a little easier. She had planned to become a physical therapist to help others. Her mission changed that fateful July day. She's now helping others by taking steps and speaking up. The trunk of the red maple still bears scars from the crash, with chunks of bark missing from when truck and tree met. As she stands next to the tree, Thomas searches for the words to describe her emotions. It's somewhere between 'I told you so' and the impossible, she says. Somewhere between possible and impossible.Being here gives me a sense of power, because I lost a life here. But I also gained a brand new one. And I'm proud of the new life I have.Thomas is part of innovative research conducted at the at the University of Louisville. In a study published Monday in the New England Journal of Medicine, two of four patients with motor complete spinal cord injury -- meaning no voluntary movement below their injury -- were able to walk again after being implanted with a  and then undergoing extensive physical therapy. They walk with the aid of walkers. This should change our thinking about people with paralysis, said Susan Harkema, one of the lead researchers on the project and a professor in the Department of Neurological Surgery at the University of Louisville. It's phenomenal. This new knowledge is giving us the tools to develop new strategies and tools for recovery in people with chronic spinal injuries.Claudia Angeli, the other lead researcherand a senior researcher at the Human Locomotion Research Center at Frazier Rehab Institute in Louisville, said it's a fascinating time to be involved in spinal cord research, bringing together decades of investigations culminating in modern-day breakthroughs. It just shows the capacity of the spinal cord and how much we're learning about using the epidural stimulation in combination with therapy, Angeli said., their  has involved14 paralyzed people who have received what is called an epidural stimulator implanted over a portion of the lower spinal cord, enabling neurons below their injuries to receive signals the brain used to send before their accidents. All 14 patients have experienced  with the implant, the researchers said. They  also showed improvement in bowel and bladder function.The latest study focused on four patients, including Thomas who underwent therapy twice a day for five days a week for many months.  A morning therapy session would involve working on stepping; an afternoon session would focus on standing. Thomas's therapy lasted 10 monthsafter receiving the implant. All four were able to stand independently, and two were able to walk over ground, the researchers said. One patient fractured his hip, setting his therapy back by several months, the researchers said.The other patient who was able to walk over ground had been paralyzed from his neck down with no ability to move his arms until he received the stimulator. With the stimulator off, Angeli said, he can't even sit up.Harkema and Angeli said they believe the positive results were the combination of the stimulation and improved physical therapy treatment. Harkema underwent a federal investigation a couple years ago. Certain research activities were determined to be in violation of federal regulations, according to a The letter states the University of Louisville took adequate corrective actions to address the noncompliance. Harkema says she stands by her work. What's it like to see people who are paralyzed walk again? I draw inspiration from every person with a spinal cord injury who comes into this program, Harkema said. They each have their own unique personalities and spirits. They are just pioneers.Adding to the excitement of these advancements, another study published Monday in the journal Nature Medicine unveiled similar results. A man paralyzed since 2013 regained his ability to stand and walk with assistance due to spinal cord stimulation and physical therapy, according to research done in collaboration with the Mayo Clinic and the University of California, Los Angeles.What this is teaching us is that those networks of neurons below a spinal cord injury still can function after paralysis, Dr. Kendall Lee, the co-principal investigator and director of Mayo Clinic's Neural Engineering Laboratories, said in a press release.There have been other cases in recent years in which paralyzed people have risen from their wheelchairs and walked.  and showed success in using rehabilitation combined with what is called brain-computer interface, in which brain signals were sent to an electrical stimulator or exoskeleton resulting in the generation of muscle activity, allowing some patients to walk.They're different in terms of the way to activate the central nervous system, but the overall outcome is similar, said Monica Perez, a professor in the Department of Neurological Surgery with the Miami Project to Cure Paralysis at the University of Miami. Monday's studies, Perez said, provide important additional evidence to the continued advances being made in the spinal cord injury field. She said it shows more proof that people with severe paralysis often have residual connections that can be engaged in a functionally relevant manner -- and that's amazing. What the studies demonstrate is that those connections in the central nervous system can still be recruited, even though you have an injury from years ago, said Perez, who was not connected to either study. From a scientific point of view, she said, an important consequence of the studies is the awareness that we need to work harder to understand how we can better involve those connections, she said. These people with more severe paralysis are regaining this level of function -- and that is beautiful. We also need more accurate assessments of our patients.It's not the first time an individual with severe clinically complete paralysis has walked with assistive technology without the help of a therapist, she said. But it's tremendously important that in more cases the potential of these approaches can be demonstrated.Harkema and Angeli, whose study was funded in part by the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation, said it's imperative for stakeholders to come together to fund more research to help as many of the 1.2 million people with paralysis. More than 8,000 have expressed interest in being research participants in their program. For Thomas, it's even more personal. She wants others with injuries as severe as hers to experience the transformation she's gone through. Nothing's going to be able to stop me in life, because I took something that was thought to be impossible, and I turned it into possible, she says.Since she was a child, Thomas has loved to ride horses. She'd saddle up her horse Shadow and take off across the family's ranch. At rodeos, she and Shadow were inseparable. All you need is love and a horse, the motto next to her bed says.In her late teens, she would run 3 to 4 miles a day, train horses and do endurance weight training at the gym almost every day. She worked as a waitress while attending college to become a physical therapist. All of that was shattered in an instant. The young woman who had been so active was now confined to a chair at the age of 19. It was a fate she could not accept.Not only had she lost her ability to walk, she'd lost bladder control and sexual function. If she went outside, her body temperature would skyrocket over 101 degrees because it could no longer regulate itself. Every bit of her independence, she felt, had been stripped. I was lying there saying, 'there is no way I can sit in this chair the rest of my life,'  she says. I have way too many things to do.To walk again, she'd have to cowboy up, as she puts it. She'd rely on the toughness instilled in her by her father from working on the ranch. It would push her to the limits, at times leaving her on the floor crying, wanting to quit. She'd heard about the program in Louisville. She first went for a screening in January 2017. She returned a month later and stayed through May to do physical therapy, working on standing and stepping for an hour every day. The stimulator would require a major surgery and a commitment to stay in Louisville for at least a year. She wrestled with the decision. She talked with several men who had the stimulator. They had made gains after the implant, but at the time, no one had walked. She thought, what's the point of going through so much work?Just being able to stand or wiggle my toes, she says, was not enough for me.One of her sisters spoke with her. She told Thomas that she didn't want her to wonder what if for the rest of her life. No one knew what Thomas' decision would be.  On August 5, 2017, the family's vehicle was loaded up. Are we going? her father asked. They drove the 13 hours to Louisville. The stimulator was implanted the next month. Sensation swept through her body as soon as it was turned on.There was this rushing vibration, she says. It was like a highlighter of my muscles. All of them were contracting. It was wild.The real work lay in the months ahead. She had endured physical therapy sessions three times a week for three years prior to the implant. That helped set her on a path for success, she says, but it was nothing close to how hard the work over the next year would be. She attended physical therapy fives times a week, a couple of hours every day.She clung to her faith during the most agonizing sessions, repeating phrases to herself: I can do all things through Christ, who strengthens me and God is with me. I will not fail.I tell you what: After the implant, I was introduced to a whole new ballgame, she says. The hardest thing I've ever had to do in my life. I prayed my way through so many sessions, just to get me through, because I wanted to quit.The stimulator does not move her legs for her. It stimulates neurons and nerves, allowing her to consciously control the movement. It began small -- wiggling of toes -- then one leg being able to move and then figuring out how to sync her legs to be able to walk.She was wearing a black T-shirt with the phrase No Days Off on that magical day in February. She took a step or two, and then her therapist broke out in dance. The two hugged and cried. Oh, my God, Thomas said. She wiped away the tears and took more steps. It was like trying to pat your tummy and rub your head at the same time, she says explaining how it felt trying to coordinate her legs, body and mind.  Trying to trust my body, trying to find a cadence, was very hard.Thomas can now walk and talk at the same time, but she still must focus on each step.She presses a device against her abdomen to turn the stimulator on. I'm still paralyzed as can be without it, she says. When she stands, she asks herself, How do I walk, again?Beyond helping her walk, the stimulator has restored sexual function and much of her bladder control. She has regained muscle mass, and nerve pain in her right foot has disappeared. I'm totally pro stimulator. I love it, she says.Strolling across her front lawn at the family ranch, she says that her No. 1 goal in the short term is to get rid of her walker. She'd love to be able to run again. She points to the nearby barn that houses Shadow. She longs to be able to walk to the barn by herself, saddle her up and get on. She'd longs to get Shadow in a full gallop again. That's the day I'll accept that I'm healed, she says. For now, she's taking every day one stride at a time. She says her story is not about herself; it's about helping others. She's buoyed by messages of support from friends and strangers alike. She says it's for them that she works so hard. In town, that encouragement is on full display.I just want to tell you congratulations, sweetie. You're doing beautiful, a woman tells her outside the Homosassa Public Library.A man in a pickup sees her struggling at her car. Need some help? he asks.No, sir, she responds.

{"title": "Love and heroin don't mix: how these newlyweds survived a harrowing romance", "cate": "health", "content": "There's nothing sweet or adorable about the way newlyweds Brittany and Ryan Coleman first met -- no meet cutelike in rom-com movies or romance novels.  It was 2015, and Brittany bought heroin from Ryan in a parking lot, and Ryan cheated her. Brittany called him some choice names, and Ryan shrugged his shoulders and walked off. Despite that inauspicious beginning, and the many years of drug abuse that precededit, the Colemans want to get out this message: There is life and love after drug addiction. They want to give hope to those whose lives have been ravaged by the , which kills more than 115 people every day in the United States. You just have to find the right people to get connected to to kind of show you the way out, said Brittany, 29. When Brittany Hokrein was 11 years old, her parents divorced, and she and her brothers and mother moved from Georgia to Pennsylvania. She struggled emotionally, and at age 14 she started to use marijuana and alcohol so she wouldn't feel the hurt. Soon, pain pills became her drug of choice, and by age 18 she was addicted. Ryan, now 37, was born into a military family, moving from Georgia to Germany to Texas and then back to Georgia. Like Brittany, he had a loving family, but as a teenager, he felt like he didn't fit in, and he started to smoke pot at age 14. I found that I could medicate that feeling. Life was great once I got high, he said. By the time Ryan was 17, he was smoking pot every day, and he dropped out of high school senior year. He moved on to LSD and cocaine. By the time he was 20 he was hooked on painkillers. His father, an Army drill sergeant, and his mother, a high school teacher, begged him to go to recovery. They told him a recovery program had saved his mother from alcoholism when Ryan was a child. But he rebelled and rejected everything his parents stood for. By 22, he was strung out on heroin. I had to have it, he said. Over the next 10 years, Brittany and Ryan unknowingly led parallel lives. Hopping from city to city, they both used heroin, methamphetamines, prescription opioids, Xanax, cocaine and alcohol.Brittany overdosed three times, and Ryan overdosed five times. Ryan got arrested 16 times, mostly for stealing so he could get money to buy drugs. Brittany stole, too, and had a stint at prostitution. Their parents loved them and helped get them into rehab programs. Each stint ended in a relapse. By 2016, both Ryan and Brittany had moved back to Augusta, Georgia. They happened to end up at the same recovery group meeting. Eight months had passed since they'd met at that drug deal in the parking lot. He's cute, Brittany thought when she met him again at rehab. She's beautiful, Ryan thought. Really beautiful. And she looked so familiar. He realized she was the woman he'd cheated in the drug deal. I thought, 'This was fate.' I walked right up to her and told her I needed to apologize for ripping her off, Ryan remembered. I did want to make amends, but I also had an ulterior moment. I wanted to date her.Dating was discouraged in their recovery program -- and Brittany and Ryan found out why. As they fell in love, they spent all their time together and their lives became intertwined. At first they both stayed sober but then slowly, imperceptibly, Ryan slipped away, taking Brittany with him. After about four months of dating, one Friday morning Ryan told Brittany he was going down to a park by the Savannah River to think about his life. But instead, he drove two hours to Atlanta to buy heroin and cocaine.He called her on the way and told her the truth. Brittany stood there with her phone in her hand. She wrote out a text that she knew she shouldn't send. It said that Ryan needed to bring back some drugs for her. She stared at the text for a while. Then she hit send. And everything fell apart. For the next week, Brittany and Ryan went right back to heroin, right back to cocaine, right back to meth, sometimes all at the same time. I even romanticized it, saying f*** all the rules, we're going to be heroin junkies together, all that 'Trainspotting' bull****, he said, referring to the 1996 film about young Britons on heroin. Addicts have a sick way of romanticizing their drug use. Then on October 3, 2016, they both overdosed on meth and heroin. Medics found Brittany lying on the floor of a gas station bathroom, and Ryan right outside, unconscious in his car.The medics gave them doses of Narcan, the drug that reverses overdoses. Brittany had done so much heroin she needed two doses. Ryan was wracked with guilt. He felt personally responsible for Brittany's near death in that gas station bathroom. He was the one who'd driven to Atlanta to get drugs when they were both working so hard to be clean. He was the one who said 'yes' when she asked him to bring some back for her. I had almost killed the person I loved the most, he said. Brittany returned to Hope House, a treatment center for women in Augusta. Ryan visited here there. Surrounded by his sponsor from his recovery group and Brittany's counselors, he got down on his knees -- and apologized. He held my hand and apologized to me in front of all those people, Brittany said, crying at the memory of it. He was shaking and I was shaking. He said how sorry he was for putting me through all this and how scared he was to almost lose me. They then had to do something they describe as just as hard as giving up heroin: They had to give each other up. For a month, they had no contact at all. The only way for us to survive was to focus only on our recovery, and not on each other, Brittany said. It was the only way it would work. Brittany then left Hope House, and the two met up at their recovery group's Thanksgiving dinner. They started back dating slowly, and then a year and a half later, on February 24, 2018, they were married.Next month marks two years of sobriety for both Brittany and Ryan, and today they live in a small house with four cats in Augusta. Ryan works at a vape store, where he's advanced from part-time clerk to assistant manager to manager. Brittany works at a rehab center, helping others overcome their addictions. They volunteer to help others in recovery and have also spoken at programs that train people how to use Narcan, the drug that saved both of them so many times. When asked how they survived addiction where so many have died, they say it was the grace of God and to a large degree luck -- luck that those Narcan doses were available right when they needed them. They also say they let other people guide them: their families, who never gave up on them; the rehab counselors who stuck with them; and their recovery mentors who showed them the way, including that they needed to focus on their individual recoveries and not on each other in order to survive. All of those people joined them on their wedding day.It was really a culmination of all the good things going on in our lives finally really coming together, Ryan said. Sometimes Brittany can't believe she's alive, much less in a loving, stable relationship. It's unbelievable. I don't think that I would have ever imagined that I would be married and happy and just planning a future with another human, she said. I didn't ever picture that for myself. They want people in the throes of addiction to see that despite the dire statistics, there can be hope. I want them to see people like us and realize that we were in that same place at one point in our lives -- and we got out, Ryan said. CNN's John Bonifield contributed to this story."},
{"title": "This teen's body was 'bending by the hour.' His 18th surgery changed his life", "cate": "health", "content": "John Sarcona was at a baseball game when his mother Joanne found the bloodied T-shirts in his laundry hamper. His bedding was bloody too, and she knew something had gone terribly wrong.I told myself that this can't be happening, Joanne said. I'm putting two and two together, and I'm trying to get a hold of John. Nobody is answering my calls or texts, and I'm frantic, my mind is running.John, now 19, had been diagnosed at age 5 with what would become an extreme case of scoliosis and kyphosis. He'd already had 16 surgeries, with doctors placing metal implants along his spine to support his back as he grew. When the 16-year-old finally came home after his mother noticed the bloody clothes, Joanne took him upstairs and calmly asked, John, can you take off your shirt? What she saw still haunts her: metal rods protruding from her son's back. They had broken before, requiring additional surgeries to repair, but this was different. They looked like cysts and tumors on John's back, she remembers.Within a few weeks, John was back in the hospital for his 17th surgery to remove them once and for all, and the recovery was grueling. Every 15 minutes, Joanne said, the nurses would tell John to take deep breaths. But he'd say to them, 'I can't. I'm in pain. How can I keep my oxygen levels at 99% if I'm dying here?' I can't do this anymore, John told his mom, ripping off his pulse oximeter. I want to go home.When he was 6 years old, John was told to wear a brace for 22 hours a day, taking it off only to shower. His mother decorated the brace with stickers and his classmates signed it with their names. But even in elementary school, John felt different. I wouldn't want to be around my friends with it on, he said. It was just so annoying.Scoliosis, the curving of the spine from side to side, affects about 2% to 3% percent of the population,  the American Association of Neurological Surgeons. Kyphosis is the bending of the spine forward in the upper back -- leading to a hunchback appearance. Bracing is a common treatment for both conditions in children.But for all its inconvenience, the brace did little to help John's worsening spine. He needed surgery, doctors said, and he soon had the operation to insert the rods into his back. Every six months, John returned to the hospital to lengthen them as he grew.But after 17 operations, those rods were gone -- and John's condition was as bad as ever. It's important to understand that surgery can do a lot, said Dr. Jeffrey Wang, president of the North American Spine Society and co-director of the USC Spine Center. But surgery can't do everything. It's not always the fault of the kid or the doctor or the patient if it fails.John's surgeon, unable to treat him any further, recommended Dr. Lawrence Lenke, surgeon-in-chief at the Daniel and Jane Och Spine Hospital at NewYork-Presbyterian and a former president of the Scoliosis Research Society. Part of my practice is taking care of things that other people can't take care of, said Lenke. Some surgeons, at some point, are not comfortable treating these conditions.  John's condition continued to worsen after he returned home from his rod removal. When the family went to  a month later, Lenke said that John was bending by the hour. Joanne was wary of any more procedures. Her son had been under the knife so often that doctors had trouble closing his skin after operations.She was a little terrified of any more surgeries, Lenke said, because none of them seemed to work. Her direct words were, 'I trusted a surgeon for so long. How do I trust you?'Indeed, Joanne remembers, I didn't trust him at first. And I ask for forgiveness every day for that. But there was no other option, and the surgery had to be done.John's kyphosis, an outward curvature of his spine that hunched his back, was so severe that it impacted his breathing, leaving him with only 22% of his lung capacity when he arrived at NewYork-Presbyterian. Walking through school, even from one end to the other, I'd be out of breath, John remembered. It was definitely a struggle.He needed surgery, but Lenke's proposal was risky -- a slight complication and John could have been paralyzed for life. Called a vertebral column resection, Lenke would separate John's spine into different sections, remove two vertebrae at the very center of the severe kyphosis, then straighten the spine as he brought the pieces back together.It does work well, Lenke said, but the issue is that we have to take the vertebra out around the spinal cord, and that's risky. His mother was terrified, but John had few options.The risk of doing nothing was that her son was going to suffocate or die, Lenke said, and she could see that slowly happening.The surgery was a harrowing one. For 13 hours, Lenke operated on John with a spinal fellow and a scrub nurse as other staff rotated in and out of the operating room. Not everything went according to plan.We test electrical activity, Lenke said, and in the middle of taking a vertebrate out, the spinal cord activity went away. That isn't unheard of -- Lenke said it happens in about 30% of surgeries like John's -- but for an hour, he was technically paralyzed. Lenke powered through the surgery, working quickly to remove pressure from the spinal cord, and John emerged from the operation with no complications. The doctors were soaking wet in their scrubs from top to bottom, said Joanne. They were completely exhausted. They never stopped working, and they saved my son's life.The top of John's spine had been bent forward over 120 degrees before his surgery, making it difficult to stand straight up and perform daily tasks like walking up stairs.I was collapsing on myself, John said. His operation was so drastic that it changed his body's center of gravity.Those first steps, leaning up against the bed, I felt like I was in a new body, John said. It's a pretty crazy feeling and I still remember it today. It was almost like learning how to walk again.It was his 18th surgery, but things felt different this time. This might be a chance at a new life, he remembers thinking. I could feel myself getting stronger with each step.A year later, John graduated high school and attended his senior prom. I was just praying everyday for a miracle to happen, that I would be able to see my son graduate, said Joanne. When it finally happened earlier this year, it was a beautiful day, she said.John is now seven inches taller and regularly plays basketball and golf, activities that were unthinkable before his surgery. He's learning how to drive, too, and is currently a student at Nassau Community College on Long Island.He isn't sure exactly what he wants to do when he graduates, but John dreams of being a doctor.Since I was helped as a child, I want to help children as they're growing up and dealing with their own situations, he said. And while he isn't picking up the scalpel just yet, John has some advice for those who might be struggling like he did.If you just stay positive, he said, and work through and deal with the pain of the situation, if you can just get through that, then there are going to be brighter days.Davide Cannaviccio contributed to this story."},
{"title": "Doctors' son died 10 days before flu shot appointment. Now, they want to save your child", "cate": "health", "content": "Two physicians who lost their young son to the flu last year want parents to listen to their message, born of great grief and suffering: Get your child a flu shot. Drs. Laura and Anthony Sidari's 4-year-old son, Leon, did not get the flu vaccine last year. He died on Christmas Day, less than 48 hours after he started feeling sick. I didn't know a condition could kill a child that quickly who had been previously healthy, said Laura, a psychiatrist. This has been a hard haul for us, and we're very private people, but we're trying to help other families.Leon was one of 185 US children who died in the 2017-18 flu season, according to the  -- a historic high. Approximately 80% of those children had not received a flu shot, according to the Laura and Anthony, a rheumatologist, had wanted to get Leon and his 2-year-old brother flu shots at a pharmacy. They lived in Texas, where  prohibits pharmacists from vaccinating anyone under the age of 7.The couple, busy with their newborn third child, Cameron, decided to get Leon a flu shot when they were going to the pediatrician anyway: when 2-year-old Tristan had his annual visit, scheduled for January 3. Leon died 10 days before that appointment. It wasn't even on my radar as something that I really, really needed to prioritize, Laura said.  It just slipped through the cracks. The Sidaris' story is all too familiar to Dr. Flor Mu\u00f1oz. For 20 years, Mu\u00f1oz, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at Texas Children's Hospital, has worked with the American Academy of Pediatrics to increase the rate of flu vaccination for children. The rates aren't great: Only 47.8% of children 6 months to 17 years old have had a flu shot in the previous year, according to the , which recommends that everyone over 6 months get a flu shot. The problem: Though adults can get flu shots at pharmacies or even at work, children don't have as many options. In most states, there are limits or outright bans on pharmacists vaccinating children, and flu vaccine clinics at schools are the exception rather than the rule. Only 13 states allow pharmacists to vaccinate children of any age, according to the It's frustrating. It seems like we don't learn, Mu\u00f1oz said. There's no medical reason children shouldn't get flu shots at a pharmacy, said Mu\u00f1oz, who is also an associate professor of pediatrics at Baylor College of Medicine.Some states are changing their laws. New York used to bar pharmacists from giving flu shots to anyone under 18. This year, after the historic flu season, the state changed its laws to permit vaccination for anyone 2 or older. Good for you, New York! Mu\u00f1oz said. More should be done to make this happen in other states. There should be more of a push. Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, said more should also be done to make it easier for local health departments to offer flu shot clinics. Right now, he said, it's difficult for those departments to purchase large quantities of vaccine and to bill insurance. We need to do more to make it easy, he said. The Sidaris are doing their part. Last month, they sponsored a Say Boo to the Flu event in their hometown, Albion, New York, where 59 children were vaccinated. Although the CDC encourages flu vaccines by the end of October each year, it's especially important to get the shot well before the holidays, Mu\u00f1oz said. Flu activity can peak in December, and holiday get-togethers can make the virus spread more quickly. It takes about two weeks for the shot to become effective after you receive it. Leon is my reason this season, and every season, for getting flu shots on time, Laura Sidari wrote on her  page. Holiday planning and fall festivities can wait, but the flu shot cannot. A previous version of this story incorrectly stated where the Sidaris lived last year. "},
{"title": "She drank kratom tea while pregnant. Then her newborn went into withdrawal", "cate": "health", "content": "The woman had used oxycodone for almost a decade but told her doctors she had been sober for two years. She never touched narcotics during her pregnancy, she said, and had completed rehab.But her newborn son was in withdrawal: jittery, screaming and requiring an infusion of morphine to stay alive. The infant craved drugs, but why?Amid an , the boy's doctors didn't blame heroin, fentanyl or other illicit substances. Instead, they said, the infant had grown dependent on a controversial herbal supplement: kratom.According to  in the journal Pediatrics, both the unnamed woman and her infant passed urine drug screens that looked specifically for oxycodone and other opioids. But those tests didn't look for kratom, a legal drug that has opioid-like effects at high doses.The plant, which is native to Southeast Asia, is  used to treat pain and curb opioid cravings. Acting on the same brain receptors as morphine and similar drugs, it is  as a solution to the opioid epidemic but  by the US Food and Drug Administration as a potentially dangerous psychoactive drug. The mother denied using any substances during her pregnancy -- legal or otherwise -- but her husband told doctors that she drank kratom tea daily to treat her withdrawal symptoms and help with sleep.I fear that women making genuine commitments to overcome their dependency may develop a false sense of safety by using a substance that is advertised as a non-opioid alternative, said Dr. Whitney Eldridge, a neonatologist for BayCare Health System in Florida who was lead author on the case report.The mother might have been well-intentioned, but because tests showed no other drugs in her or the infant, her doctors said kratom probably caused her son's condition, known clinically as neonatal abstinence syndrome. On his eighth day of life, after he had been weaned off opioids and observed without any medications, the boy was discharged to his parents.It's rare, but FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb said in a statement that this case is not unique. He said the FDA is aware of four other cases involving neonates exposed to kratom while in utero who experienced neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome after term delivery. Gottlieb, whose agency has issued a    on kratom, called the new report a tragic case of harm and said it further illustrates the concerns the FDA has identified about kratom, including the potential for abuse and addiction.And though Eldridge hopes more research will help lawmakers better regulate kratom, she believes that physicians today need to counsel women who are pregnant about the risk of kratom such as they would any other legal substance that can have ill effects on their newborn.Some experts are hesitant to draw any conclusions from the report. They note that although maternal kratom use could theoretically cause neonatal abstinence syndrome, the case did not explicitly link kratom to the infant's withdrawal symptoms.I'm not surprised that this is possible, said Dr. Andrew Kruegel, an associate research scientist at Columbia University, because kratom certainly has opioid effects and can induce tolerance in users, especially at higher doses.But Kruegel, who has studied the plant for seven years, noted that doctors weren't able to test the purported kratom itself. The main limitation is that we don't know anything about the dosage that the mother was taking, he said. Without that information, you can't really extrapolate too much.And the mother might not have been taking kratom at all, said Dr. Edward W. Boyer, an associate professor at Harvard Medical School and a physician in the Department of Emergency Medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital.It's the husband who reported the kratom use, he said. The wife who actually ingested the product, who thought it was kratom, and the authors of the case report itself, none of those people actually verified that she was ingesting kratom.Despite the FDA's warnings, kratom is  and is sometimes sold as a tea in . The nonprofit American Kratom Association  that 3 million to 5 million Americans use the substance, and the group says it's open to warning labels on kratom products.We believe that, as in many supplements, there should be a warning that pregnant women shouldn't take this, Dave Herman, the association's chairman, said. That's not because we think it's detrimental. It's because it's a safety measure.Kratom acts on opioid receptors, which the FDA says is  of its potential for abuse. The agency points to  associated with kratom, but Kruegel said that if you look at those 44 deaths, the vast majority of them involve other substances, including other strong opioids.Boyer said kratom may have other risks, such as seizures, but he noted that it might be safer than most opioids because there does not seem to be respiratory depression when kratom is used alone. Respiratory depression -- slow and ineffective breathing -- is what makes opioid overdoses so deadly. That's why Boyer believes well-regulated kratom could one day be used in the fight against opioid addiction, steering users away from more dangerous drugs.If you do the right thing and do the rigorous studies, then there is no reason why [kratom] shouldn't be a prescription pharmaceutical that serves as a bridge to formal drug treatment, particularly for individuals who can't get into therapy, Boyer said.The American Kratom Association says there's little incentive for pharmaceutical companies to study kratom as a potential prescription drug, especially because they can't patent the raw plant.If I'm a drug company, I think that it costs somewhere, depending on who you speak to, between $1.2 and $1.8 billion to bring a new drug to market, Herman said. Who would spend that kind of money when some other guy can just get on a boat, ride down a river and grab it off a tree?Because kratom is considered a , manufacturers don't need FDA approval to sell it as long as their products don't claim to cure or treat specific conditions or symptoms. But some companies have done just that,  for saying their products could relieve opioid withdrawal or treat a myriad of ailments. The association says those cases are anomalies.The reality is, our belief is, this is America, Herman said. And if a product is useful for your health and well-being, you should have the right to take it, as long as it doesn't harm you. And we haven't seen any evidence of that harm.The FDA, however, continues to warn against kratom, even suggesting that it could worsen the opioid epidemic.Kratom has never been studied in humans, Gottlieb said in the statement. What consumers and health care providers need to understand is that there are no proven medical uses for kratom. Instead, as the FDA has warned, kratom can cause serious harm and is contributing to the opioid crisis."},
{"title": "Her kidney donation now could save her granddaughter's life later", "cate": "health", "content": "When Meghann Adams learned that she was pregnant in early 2015, she was ecstatic. Starting a family with her husband, Chris, had not been easy, but she was carrying twins. They were to be named Delly and Aubrey.The entire family delighted in preparing for their arrival. Adams' mom, Jamie McNeil, made plans to retire and moved across the country to help care for them. It was the best feeling ever, Adams, 35, told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta in the family's home near Atlanta.Twenty weeks into her pregnancy, Adams had an anatomy scan, a key ultrasound in which the fetuses' development is measured. The sonographer was upbeat and pointed out all the different parts of the girls. But when the doctor came in, the tone changed.Although Aubrey appeared to be healthy and growing well, the ultrasound revealed cysts on one of Delly's kidneys. The Adamses were ushered in to meet with a genetic counselor. Stats and medical terms were bandied around. The diagnosis: multicystic dysplastic kidney, which is believed to affect one in 3,500 births. It occurs when the kidney is malformed and full of cysts and, as a result, can't function. In most cases, children who have just one kidney live normal lives; the remaining kidney will take over and essentially do double duty. But in some cases, a kidney transplant might be necessary.McNeil, the twins' grandmother, wanted to be a donor, but there was no way to know if or when Delly might need a kidney.It was just really overwhelming and devastating, Adams said. We were on pins and needles for a while, just really unsure.Delly and Aubrey were born six weeks early, in December 2015. Because of her diagnosis, Delly was immediately taken into the neonatal intensive care unit for monitoring. I didn't even get to hold her the first day when she was born, Adam said. Those initial days were a blur. Adams was recovering from a C-section and trying to get the hang of breastfeeding. Delly was prodded and poked, her kidney monitored to make sure it was keeping up.  At just 6 days old, she began to experience renal failure.I just didn't know how to react or what to do, Adams said, and my mind was going in a million different directions.Doctors began talking about dialysis and transplants, but Delly was simply too small and too young for surgery. Slowly, Delly's kidney began to pick up. She was in the NICU for her first month, and every day, her blood was tested. At 3 months, Delly's blood levels were stable. But her healthy kidney hadn't grown as much as doctors had hoped by the end of her first year.Her nephrologist began talking about the potential need for a transplant -- not immediately, but maybe not so far into Delly's future.For those in need of a kidney transplant, the wait is long. Of the waiting for a kidney last year, only about 20% were able to find a match, according to the United Network of Organ Sharing. Finding that match took an average of  Delly's next big test will be puberty, when they'll see whether her kidney will be able to keep up with her growing body. Knowing that Delly could one day find her self on the waiting list for a kidney,Adams and her mother, McNeil, began researching options to prepare.McNeil didn't hesitate: She dreamed of being a donor. But she's in her 50s and would probably be too old to donate by the time Delly actually needed a kidney. And that's how they came across an innovative new program, the National Kidney Registry's Voucher Program.  Essentially, it's a gift certificate for an organ, Adams said. The program began at the University of California, Los Angeles four years ago, when then-64-year-old Howard Broadman approached the UCLA Kidney Exchange Program led by transplant surgeon Dr. Jeffrey Veale with the idea of donating his kidney to a stranger now in exchange for a voucher that would potentially provide a kidney for his grandson in the future. Like Delly, Broadman's grandson, Quinn, then 4, was born with chronic kidney disease. And like McNeil, Broadman was a chronological mismatch with his grandchild -- probablytoo old to donate by the time the boyneeded one.Veale mulled the idea over. Living donor transplants can cut wait times by years, and research has shown that that living donor kidneys tend to those from deceased donors. Veale didn't want to lose out on the opportunity of a potential donor. After all, altruistic donors -- people willing to donate to complete strangers -- were key in jump-starting transplant chains that could benefit multiple patients. Transplant chains are able to take pairs of mismatched living donors and recipients and scramble them around to create chains of matching pairs. The longest chain has resulted in over 100 kidney transplants or swaps. But these chains require all donors be ready to give and recipients ready to receive at the same time.  Veale decided to add Broadman to the donor pool to start a chain. In return, Quinn received a voucher that would place him at the end of a future chain once he needed a kidney. The voucher capitalizes on donor-recipient pairs who are chronologically incompatible, Veale said. These are patients who want to donate their kidney now but are waiting for their loved one, who doesn't quite need a kidney yet.Adding chronological mismatches into the donor pool only improves everyone's chances at finding a match, explained , a transplant surgeon at Emory University and McNeil's doctor.It really would be in our best interest as a community to come together and have as many pairs as possible in a system to allow for the most transplants possible, Turgeon said.The vouchers are all coordinated through the National Kidney Registry's living donor databases. At least  have been distributed, and two have been redeemed. A voucher can be activated only by the person it is initially designated for, and it expires when the voucher holder dies. The first three voucher donations triggered  For Delly and her grandmother, the voucher program was the answer. McNeil had long hoped to find a way to be an organ donor. When the retired nurse learned of a colleague who had advanced breast cancer and needed a bone marrow transplant, McNeil immediately signed up to be a bone marrow donor. She's never been called to donate, though, and always wondered about other ways to help.My soul needs a connection with humanity, she said.There were risks; kidney donation is still surgery. And while rare, long-term impacts can include pain, nerve damage, hernia or intestinal obstruction.None of that dissuaded McNeil. I'm a nurse, so I know what all those things are. But because I'm so driven again to do it, that I just know it's the right thing to do, she said before the surgery. My soul is at peace with whatever might happen.In September, McNeil donated her kidney to a stranger. The donation inspired by her granddaughter triggered a chain of three other transplants. All the donor and recipient surgeries occurred on the same day, with organs criss-crossing the country.It's like a dream come true to me, McNeil said. For McNeil, her donation is not just a gift to Delly but part of a larger mission to better what's around her. I wish to see more love, and so I'm going to be that love, she told Gupta. If I could inspire just three more people to donate kidneys and those three people could inspire three more people. And those three could inspire three more. If you just did that 11 times over, we would completely wipe out ... the kidney waiting list. That's doable to me.McNeil said that donating a kidney would be one of the most significant days of her life. When I'm on my deathbed, she said, the thing I'm going to say that I'm the proudest of will probably be that day.McNeil returned home just a day after her surgery, and though she was sore, she was in the best of spirits.  Her kidney had been sent to a recipient at the University of Rochester Medical Center in New York. A donor there sent a kidney to a recipient at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, and a donor there sent one to a recipient at the Nicoletti Kidney Transplant Center at Jefferson Health in Pennsylvania.The chain ended with a final donor from Jefferson sending a kidney to a recipient at New York Presbyterian.The news that excited McNeil most that day was to hear that her kidney had been received and was already producing urine for its new recipient. These chains exemplify how we're more similar than different, often matching patients of different ethnicities, religions, genders, sexuality and political affiliation. There are other benefits too, as the voucher donor helps a stranger receive a kidney today and extends the voucher donor's legacy by helping a loved one receive a kidney in the future, Veale said. We need a little more kindness in the world, and this is what these voucher donations do. Delly knows very little of the unique gift that her grandmother gave. All she knows is that her grandmother is a one-kidney person, like her. And to Delly, that doesn't mean much. At 2\u00bd, she can still run around and play with her sister in their toy kitchen, read books and giggle with her grandma."},

The horse rolled onto Anderson, who hit her head, briefly lost consciousness and broke three ribs. The 911 transcript shows that an ambulance reached the 60-year-old judge from Bismarck within 20 minutes. Anderson was secured on a backboard and ready to go when an air ambulance, a helicopter with a medical crew, also landed at the scene. Anderson says her husband asked repeatedly whether the ground ambulance crew could take her by ground; there was a hospital less than an hour's drive away. But he was told that [the air ambulance] was necessary. They never told him why it was necessary or how much it cost, but they insisted I had to go by air ambulance, Anderson said. But it's so odd there is nothing in the record that indicated it was time-sensitive or that I needed to be airlifted.For that one helicopter ride, to a hospital farther away in Bismarck, records show that Valley Med Flight charged Anderson $54,727.26. Sanford Health Plan, her insurance, paid $13,697.73. That left Anderson with a $41,029.53 bill.Valley Med Flight did not respond to requests for comment.It shocked me, Anderson said. I kept thinking, 'my God.' I got a copy of the 911 and air ambulance report to see how long they actually spent with me, when really, it was only around 45 minutes. I wrote [the air ambulance company] a letter telling them that I thought it was all outrageous. Anderson is not alone. CNN reached out to every state's insurance regulatory office. Nearly every one said it has heard from patients like Anderson, and complaintsabout air ambulance bills have  according to the Mississippi commissioner of insurance. Charges vary wildly. CNN saw bills ranging from nearly $34,000 to more than $533,000. A found that costs for an average air ambulanceflight doubled between 2010 and 2014. Some states saw even bigger increases. New Mexico bills went up 229% between 2006 and 2015, a state Each state's law varies in what can be disclosed about these complaints due to its interpretation of patient privacy. In some cases, CNN could see details about the patient's condition, how far and where they were flown, how much they were charged, how much insurance paid and the nature of the complaint. Some states released much less. Some would acknowledge only that there had been complaints. However,it's clear that these bills can be devastating for families.  One complaint sent to the Michigan insurance office says a family flew a dying relative home after he got sick in Arizona. To get him to a hospice in Michigan cost $547,725. It cost another family $62,749.35to fly a child with a malignant brain tumor from Wisconsin to Houston to see a specialist. But these high prices aren't just for cross-country flights. An air ambulance transferred a man from a hospital in Winter Haven, Florida, to one in Orlando for tests, which would be a one-hour drive. The complaint to the Michigan insurance office about that Florida flight said the family faced a $31,253.33 bill.Emergency personnel requested another hospital-to-hospital transfer in Arkansas for an X-ray. It cost $37,850, according to a letter to the state insurance department. We carry insurance to avoid the catastrophic situations, wrote the man, whose name was redacted.

Few consumers have Insurance  and  have tried to help: , pleading with Congress to do something about  and unregulated rates, as one Mississippi insurance commissioner put it. Yet standalone legislation, even with bipartisan backing, has gone nowhere. The price of these flights is not regulated by Obamacare.

Air ambulances became necessary out of a desperate need to save lives, but some question whether their value remains.In 1966, civilian deaths from accidental injuries were  to the ravages of ancient plagues or world wars, the National Academy of Sciences wrote at the time. Air ambulances weren't a regular civilian option then, but when  that soldiers wounded in the  had better survival rates than California motorists injured in car accidents, the US government decided to fund two medical helicopter experiments in 1969. They were successful, and hospitals slowly started creating their own programs.A Denver hospital put the first one into service By 1980, there were 32 in the US. In the '90s, there were 231. , there were more than 1,461 air ambulances in service. Today, air ambulances provide access to care for about , according to the a nonprofit trade association.

Both of these  are predicted . That means more patients will need air ambulances.Demand for services wasn't the industry's only growth driver. The  created a new fee schedule that was much more generous to independent operators and paid more for rural trips. Almost immediately, new companies entered the market.  firms, not hospitals, now ownthe three largest air ambulance providers in the United States.  Bain Capital bought Air Medical for $1 billion  and sold it five years later . As private companies got into the market, prices went up. Between 2010 and 2014, the median price that air ambulance companies charged Medicare doubled to nearly $30,000 a ride, according to a 2017 .They have a cash cow on their hands,  Liz Thomson said. Thomson said  also found a 98% increase in the amount charged by air ambulance providers that weren't covered by insurance between 2009 and 2015. When patients travel on helicopters that are not in-network, insurance will cover little or nothing at all. The  more firms are accepting insurance -- about a dozen announced that they were going in-network this year -- but still too many do not, Thomson said, and that can be a serious issue.If they aren't in a network, they don't have to adhere to the usual customary fees that insurance will pay, said Susan Rider, an employee benefits and human capital HR consultant with  in Indianapolis. They don't have to participate, so they don't, and then essentially, they can charge what they want.In 2017, Thomson  to cap reimbursement rates and let consumers off the hook for balance bills, meaning what consumers owe above what insurance pays. The bill failed in the New Mexico Legislature, but she hopes to introduce it again.The air ambulance industry packed the committee hearing room when Thomson introduced the bill, but it was not alone. I'm a Democrat and introduce a lot of legislation around patient protection, so I had a running joke that while I don't drink, I would drink a bottle of champagne if the industry ever stood up for any of my bills, Thomson said. Sure enough, I needed to buy a bottle, because when the chair asked who was in favor of the bill, all these insurance people stood up and said, 'we are.' This practice is costing them a mint. It's outrageous., senior vice president of network services and business development for , a national firm that helps major companies manage health plans, said the costs for these services don't add up. When you really get into the math, it starts to get embarrassing for the folks running those businesses, he said. We know what their fuel costs. We know how many hours they fly and how much it costs for apilot, Castleberry said. Add up all those factors, even if you give them a 20% profit on top of that, that's still not even half what they are charging me, which is more like 300 to 400 times what it actually costs to fly our customers. When I can go rent a private plane and put medical personnel on board for less than some of these bills, I know it shouldn't cost this much.He also notes that a lot of patients whose bills the firm sees, who are told to take these flights, aren't trauma cases. They are not for a wreck on the side of the road needing Level I trauma care, Castleberry said. Only about 15% of the air ambulance charges we see involve those kind of accidents. The vast majority are patient transfers from one facility to the other.As hospitals specialize in certain types of care, there has been  of hospital-to-hospital . There are  about what  for air ambulances. Castleberry, who has clients across the country, said private operators aren't the only ones making money. County governments and city hospitals [which  can have their own air ambulance services] also see it as a revenue stream that supports their overall programs, he said. The  argues that although single flights may appear to be expensive, they are very cost-effective compared with building new rural specialty care or expanding ground ambulance capabilities.Staffing an independent helicopter around the clock is expensive. It costs about $3 million to run an independent air medical base that does roughly 300 transports a year, said , vice president of government relations for the Association of Air Medical Services.Some in the industry argue the problem is that the Centers for  and Medicaid Services don't pay enough. They created current rates in 2002, based on an estimated 1998 cost pool, increasing reimbursement for  It was never based on real cost collection, said , the association's ex-officio president and CEO.About 70% to 80% of the patients whom air ambulances transport fall into these categories that the industry argue significantly underpay, like patients with Medicare. This payment issignificantly less than the cost of the transportation, Sherlock said.Medicare pays about 60% of the cost of the flight; Medicaid pays 35% or less. Self-paid patients pay a few cents on the dollar, and that has led to a crisis of being able to sustain the service, Eastlee said. That means about 7 out of 10 of the association's flights are under-reimbursed, he said.If the government reimburses the industry more,  said, you eliminate the need to balance bill.Anderson, who was billed $54,727.26 total for her air ambulance rescue from the Badlands, got a letter from the air ambulance company's lawyer when she wrote to protest the price. HIs letter explains that 75% of that company's patients are covered by the government or have no insurance at all. This governmentally mandated cost shifting means that their cost per transport must be borne by others, the letter reads. In other words, I may not have had $54,000 worth of treatment, but essentially, they have to make up their costs somehow, Anderson said.  It's not fair at all.North Dakota Insurance Commissioner John Godfread says that Some of these bills are pretty egregious, and these are consumers who have done everything right, Godfread said. They have health insurance, they ask questions ahead of time, and often, they don't get to make the choice. It's often the hospital or the EMTs that decide to fly, but consumers are the ones left paying the bills, and there's really no way for consumers to protect themselves. Andrei Courier learned that the hard way in June. He got a $41,063.78 bill after the in-network hospital where he took his son Jacob with breathing problems transferred the boy to an out-of-network hospital. First, I could have driven to that other hospital faster, Courier said. We also had tried to do everything in-network. We did everything right insurance-wise, but we still faced this huge bill. His insurance company picked up $8,960.49 of the bill, that meant he would be left paying $32,103.29 out-of-pocket. We work hard, we pay our bills on time, and this is how we are repaid, Courier said. It was so frustrating. That's money we would use for my son's college, not for a short helicopter ride.Courier made multiple phone calls to the company, a lawyer and the Mississippi insurance commissioner. He learned that the state has a law that prevents , which is when insurance covers part of the bill and the patient owes the rest. Eventually, the cost of the flight was forgiven.I don't know what the insurance commissioner said to the company, but I finally got a call and was told they weren't going to balance bill me, Courier said, but he's still upset. Med Trans Air Medical Transport, which ran the air ambulance that day, referred questions to the Association of Air Medical Services.Other state insurance offices say usually there's little they can do, beyond holding insurance companies to the letter of their policies. Most offices  patients to call with complaints. Though states like Mississippi have balance billing protection, that tactic has had limited success elsewhere, as the courts have ruled that laws affecting air ambulances are federal, not state, jurisdiction. North Dakota tried another approach.  law required providers to disclose prices before the flight, upon request. Hospitals that referred a patient to the air ambulance company had to let the patient know the cost ahead of time unless the hospital determined that doing so would jeopardize their health or safety, in which case they would be exempt.  overturned that legislation, ruling that it was a federal matter. North Dakota's  requires hospitals to notify patients in non-emergency situations if the helicopter takes their insurance. We are optimistic. It is squarely in the claims process that we have the authority to regulate, Godfread said. It will, however, likely be appealed all the way to the US Supreme Court.The Association of Air Medical Services believes that the states can help patients right now and help address the issue of balance billing and take patients out of the middle, Eastlee said. Some insurance only covers a fraction of the price for those transports. We can work together.Virginia is trying another approach. Starting in March, will require hospitals tell patients who don't have an emergency medical condition that they have a choice between air and ground transportation.The Office of Emergency Medical Services must establish a mechanism by January to give the patient a good faith estimate.It will probably take an act of Congress to regulate the air ambulance industry. The , passed in October, created an advisory committee with all the players involved who will focus on improving price transparency. The law gives the Department of Transportation and the Department of Health and Human Services authority to create new rules. It establishes a hotline and website to track complaints, and it creates an aviation consumer advocate position.It was important to me that we craft a solution that not only empowers consumers and patients but lays the groundwork for long-term solutions in the industry, said US Rep. Rob Woodall of Georgia, who added the air ambulance-specific language to the bill.  By creating an aviation consumer advocate, much like the taxpayer advocate for those with complaints against the IRS, my amendment provides a clear mechanism through which consumers can pursue enforcement or corrective actions -- which to this point had been absent in these situations.The industry association said that it supports the FAA Reauthorization Act because it enhanced consumer protection and that the industry does want more transparency and accountability, Eastlee said, but we also have to work to sustain the service.  added, the amendment does not address the underlying problem to reduce the patient's .For Anderson, Congress is too late. She took her own action. Instead of paying $41,029.53 out of pocket, she offered to settle for $4,100, on top of the $13,000 her insurance paid.I thought, I didn't want them to sue me and wanted to get this out of the way and thought 10% more was reasonable, Anderson said. For three months, she heard nothing from the company, so she wrote to withdraw her offer. The next month, the company offered to negotiate, documents show, but eventually, it accepted her offer.Anderson's recovered from her injuries. And Cody, her horse, is OK. She brought him some extra feed to thank him, as the X-rays detected another medical issue she is now in treatment for. But the experience with the air ambulance still bothers her. For a little more than 45 minutes of service, they were asking for more than what my surgeon charged. It's not fair, Anderson said. I've since talked to other people who have been transported with no surprise bills, I think air ambulances can run in a fair manner, but the way it is currently done seems unfair and unreasonable. No one should feel shocked or panicked by a bill like this. No one ever.A previous version of this story misstated the name of Bain Capital."},

She accomplished something she didn't think she could with asthma, but because of her history of depression, running has been a lifesaver.She was the final finisher.Lisa Jackson has run 110 marathons and ultramarathons around the world. After each, she has a tradition of sleeping with the new medal around her neck to celebrate her accomplishment.In 25 of those races, she was the final finisher -- and she revels in coming in last.The world often hears the inspiring stories of elite athletes who finish first after running 26.2 miles in marathon races. For instance, Olympic medalist  at the New York City Marathon last year, becoming the first American woman to do so in 40 years. This year's marathon is scheduled to kick off Sunday morning.Yet there are equally inspiring stories among the athletes who make up the back of the pack. As Peter Ciaccia, , puts it, for every runner, there's a story.They have their own reasons why they're doing what they're doing and they're putting in all that time and energy to train, he said. Every one of those folks that crossed the finish line are inspiring, from the first to the final finish. On average, it takes bout 4\u00bd hours for men and women to complete a marathon, Ciaccia said, but that time can vary drastically among racers.In honor of Sunday's , where more than 50,000 people traveled through the five boroughs, here are four inspirational stories from the last racers in half- and full marathons.One thing they have in common: They never gave up.As Simon Kindleysides, 34,took his first steps in the London Marathon in April, it felt as if magic was in the air. As we were walking toward the first mile, we actually started blending in with all the runners, he said. Everyone was on the streets, cheering, and that was a magical moment.As time went on, the crowds and other racers dispersed. Kindleysides and his team of eight supporters continued walking. Kindleysides, who is paralyzed from the waist down and , was equipped with an exoskeleton to help him walk. His supporters walked with him to change the batteries in his exoskeleton so he could keep moving.I can walk up to four miles consecutively on one charge of the battery, he said.In 2013, Kindleysides was diagnosed with a brain tumor -- a benign glioma -- that was growing in a way that pressed on certain nerves, leading to him losing feeling in his legs. He was told he would never walk again.Before his paralysis, the London-based singer and dancer had always wanted to run a marathon, he said, but he never made the plans to do so -- until this year.Even when I was able-bodied, I took plenty for granted, Kindleysides said. You realize the time you wasted on things you didn't need to waste your time on.During the London Marathon, the last two miles were the hardest.At that point, I was exhausted. It was freezing cold, and I was hurting and emotional, Kindleysides said, but he kept going.I guess I didn't want to let people down. I had a team of eight of us, and I was raising money for , he said. I didn't want to let them down, myself down, and I thought if I'd get this far, I'd have to continue.So he continued and made history as the first paralyzed man to complete the London Marathon on foot.Once Kindleysides crossed the finish line, a live news crew interviewed him, and I said, 'I need a full body massage and a J\u00e4gerbomb.' I pinch myself. Why would I say that on live TV? I don't know. I wasn't really thinking, he said. My brain went mashed potato.Then, recovering at home, he shared his accomplishment with his three children.I was called RoboCop, Terminator and every superhero you can possibly imagine, Simon said.They used to say I'm the only dad in their whole school who's in a wheelchair, and now they say I'm their dad, the only one who has walked a marathon, he said. It was amazing, emotional, just to think I'd done it and to prove anything is possible. ... There's no such thing as can't.Kindleysides is training to complete three more marathons next year, including the London Marathon again.Meanwhile, a final finisher in the United States is preparing to run his 11th New York City Marathon on Sunday.David Fraser, who was born with cerebral palsy and uses a wheelchair, had competed in the New York Marathon before. Racing wasn't new to him, but being the final finisher last year was -- and he enjoyed the moment. Fraser said that last year he was focused on his personal training company and didn't devote as much time to training for the marathon as he normally does.My wife and my kids were there. They meet me at the end of my race every year, and they couldn't believe I was the last one, because I had done many races. I had done 5K, I had done half-marathons, I had even done ultras -- but never have I done that, said the 51-year-old New Yorker who owns a company called .But you know what? They were happy to see me complete it, he said of his family. At the start of every marathon, I have one goal -- and my goal is to complete it. I don't care about time. I care about completing the race., a group of disorders that affect muscle coordination and body movement, impacts much of Fraser's body -- but that hasn't stopped him from pursuing his love of fitness.Before 2007, he spent much of his free time weightlifting and bodybuilding, but that year, his co-workers challenged him to run the New York Marathon. He took on the challenge and completed the race. He has set out to finish it every year since.That next year, 2008, my wife developed stomach cancer, and now every year, I run the race for my wife, said Fraser, whose wife still attends his races.He even developed a strategy: Ninety percent of the race, I do backwards, he said. Because when I go downhill, I go forward, but when I go uphill and when I do even terrain, I go backwards. ... I always run that way.Overall, Fraser said, The thing that's the most difficult part of running a marathon is not the physical. The most difficult part is the mental. The reason is because when your body gives up and you are done, really done, you now have to talk yourself back into it.Fraser is preparing to complete the New York Marathon on Sunday, and he's looking forward to the race.All runners are out of their minds, he joked. Think about it. Who gets up early in the morning to run 26.2 miles? But we love it.As for one runner in Atlanta, not only does she love it, it has been a lifesaver.Amina Abdul-Jalil started running last year, around the time her mother was diagnosed with breast cancer.I realized in that time, I don't think it was even the whole month, that I had gained 10 pounds, and I was just stressed, and I thought, 'I need to do something now, or this isn't going to end well,'  Abdul-Jalil said.So she joined a running group called . To be completely honest, it's been a lifesaver in a very real way, because I have , she said.Regular exercise such as running  , something that Abdul-Jalil said she noticed firsthand.As she continued running with the group, an opportunity arose to join in an inaugural half-marathon in Atlanta called , but Abdul-Jalil was hesitant. Then she saw a video clip of ultramarathon runner , a runner with a body type similar to her own.I was like, 'she runs like me' -- and that was a big moment for me, Abdul-Jalil said. So I was like 'maybe, maybe, maybe I could pull this off.' Then she registered for The Race and trained for 12 weeks.Abdul-Jalil and I both ran that half-marathon last month. Watching her finish the race is what inspired me to seek out the stories of final finishers. She told me that she ran the race simply to see whether she could do it.Running is something that I didn't think I'd ever be able to do because I was a kid with horrible asthma, said the 41-year-old mother, who lives in the Atlanta area.And I'm not FloJo-built, she added, referencing late track-and-field athlete , who holds the 100-meter and 200-meter dash world records for women.Over the 13.1-mile course, Abdul-Jalil listened to a playlist that included songs like Twenty One Pilots' Ride and Outkast's B.O.B.Around mile three, a medical director approached her, indicating that her pace was such that the finish line might close before she got there. If that were to happen, Abdul-Jalil might not receive medical assistance if she needed it, the medical director said.In that moment, Abdul-Jalil felt discouraged.I wanted to cry and quit, and it took maybe another two miles to get that out of my head, she said. To keep her going, she thought about the running group, Black Girls Run.I literally went back to conversations that I've had, she said. Every time I said I can't do something, there was at least one or two other people that said I could.So she kept going.By the last two miles, it was just me, Abdul-Jalil said.Then, during the last mile, a race administrator and volunteer met her on the course and ran with her to the finish. They even posted a , to celebrate her as the last runner.A couple of days later, Abdul-Jalil watched the video, which has gotten more than 2,000 views.With her depression, Abdul-Jalil sometimes replays sad experiences or picks apart moments in her life -- but after watching the video of her finish, that's one external replay or something that has happened in my life where I don't pick it apart, she said. There's nothing I would change.Before the race, I had given myself a really hard time -- 'Oh, my God, what if I'm the last person?' -- and now it's something that I would do again, she said. You don't have to fit X mold to be great and to be celebrated. It's validating.Being the final finisher is something that one runner in London not only would do again, but has done 25 times.Lisa Jackson loves being the last runner.I think it's a special place in the race, said the London-based author of the book .When you're last, it's a sense of occasion. People really admire you for your grit when getting there, she said.Jackson, 51, was incredibly unathletic as a child and ran her first marathon when she was 31.After the indescribable feeling of accomplishment and joy, I thought, 'I have to experience this feeling every year, at least once,'  she said, and so she set out to run at least one marathon annually.When I first started running, my biggest fear was coming last, Jackson said. And it was actually my 31st marathon -- the South Downs Marathon -- when I was the final finisher for the first time.Jackson ran the South Downs trail marathon in the UK in June 2012. The course was hilly, the summer heat was grueling, and she wanted to give up -- but she kept running.Jackson realized that she was the last runner when she saw a man on a bicycle taking down the distance markers along the course, she said. They spoke as she continued on her way, and she made a friend.Next thing she knew, she was approaching the finish line, where other runners and race organizers gave her a standing ovation.I no longer have any fear of coming last, and if there's a risk of coming second to last, I try to drop back a little to ensure I'm in last place as we cross the line, Jackson said.After all, in that moment on the South Downs, she realized that when runners are not stressed about their time, the people they can encounter and the relationships that form can make a race that much more worthwhile.My philosophy with running is that it's not about the time you do but the time you have, said Jackson, who went on to run the New York, Boston, London, Chicago and Rome marathons, among dozens of others.I think it's really funny when people feel sorry for me for coming in last. ... I think, 'well, how many races have you run?'  she joked.When you do something that is not easy and you think you're not cut out for and you succeed at it, it gives you so much courage in other aspects of your life, she said. Running is really the most life-affirming, energizing thing you can do. Don't let the fear of coming last put you off. Every race needs a winner and a loser, and it might as well be you."},

While he was receiving excellent medical care from his doctors in California, she and her husband longed for the emotional support and guidance that could only come from the parents of a child like Lucian.But that was the problem. Lucian was one of the first children in the United States to be diagnosed with a paralyzing disease called acute flaccid myelitis, or AFM.Even on Facebook, his mother couldn't find kindred souls.Then, one day, a random class assignment gave Olivera a solution that proves that history sometimes repeats itself.Olivera was in her last semester of nursing school, and she was assigned to visit a support group that had meaning for her life. She chose a support group for polio survivors, since her son's disease and polio are similar.The members of that support group -- elderly people who had suffered a disease long since eradicated in the United States -- would change her life forever.In the late 1940s and early 1950s, polio crippled more than 35,000 people a year on average, making it one of the most feared diseases of the 20th century, .Polio and AFM are eerily similar in ways: Experts believe that both are caused by the same family of viruses. The patients, mainly children, start out with what looks like a cold or the flu, and then paralysis strikes.Since 2014, there have been 440 cases of AFM in the United States in 46 states, . The average age of patients this year is 5 years old.Thanks to the polio vaccine, the US has been , according to the CDC.But there is no cure or vaccine for AFM, and health care practitioners have had to figure out on their own the best ways to care for these children.Some have harkened back to the polio era to help their patients. Melissa Murray, a physical therapist in Oregon, scoured old medical journal articles about polio to figure out what exercises to give her patient, Bailey Sheehan, who was diagnosed with AFM in 2014 at the age 7. Her entire right side was paralyzed.I was unsure and a little nervous, because I wanted to help, but this was such uncharted territory, Murray said. I never thought I'd be going back in time to read about polio.Bailey, now 11, suffers frequent headaches, and is weak in her right arm, but she is able to walk -- something her mother credits to Murray's historical research.Melissa and her resourcefulness -- I believe that's 100 percent why Bailey is walking again, Mikell Sheehan said.Looking back in time to gain medical wisdom from an earlier disease, as Murray and others have done with AFM, is extraordinary, according to David Oshinsky, a professor of history at New York University, and author of  which won the Pulitzer Prize for history in 2006.To me, that's amazing. I've never seen a connection like that, he said.When Olivera brought her son to the Post Polio Members Support Group meeting at the Thousand Oaks community center, she at first thought maybe she'd made a mistake. These people were more than a half-century older than her son -- could they really help?  Then she saw one of the polio survivors, who sat in a motorized wheelchair, pick her leg up by grabbing the skin on the top of her thigh, much like one might pick up a puppy by the scruff of its neck.It was a very specific movement that was familiar to Olivera, because that's how Lucian moved his leg, too.She knew she was in the right place.So did the polio survivors.Seeing the boy brought back memories for us. It was like d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, said Sherrill Boyd, 79, who contracted polio when she was 9.The survivors' advice came almost immediately, some of it quite by accident. When Lucian grabbed his thigh and put his leg up on a table, Olivera, who went to etiquette school as a girl, winced. The polio survivors laughed.They said, 'He's stretching his leg. We do that too! It's good!' Olivera remembers. So now I say -- break all the etiquette rules!As Norma Puch watched Lucian and heard his story, she was reminded of her own story. Both she and Lucian got sick when they were very young -- Puch was 18 months old and Lucian was 11 months old. Like Lucian, she wears a brace on her left leg from ankle to hip.Seeing him made her remember a painful incident when she was a young woman working as a receptionist at a Los Angeles construction company. One day she stepped outside to take a break. She was wearing a classic '70s miniskirt.Hey, cover that thing up, a passerby yelled.He was referring to her leg brace.I was so mad - I thought what an idiot! remembers Puch, who's now 65. I should be ashamed because I have this metal thing on my leg?She told Olivera not to listen to the haters, and to think of Lucian as just like any other child.When I was a girl, I didn't think of myself as different, or compromised, even though I couldn't walk as fast as other children, Puch said.That advice made Olivera realize she and her husband needed to treat Lucian just like his three older siblings.Up until that point, we had him in a bubble. We would always take turns holding him, or he was always right next to us. But that wasn't going to help him at all, she remembers. After the meeting, my husband and I talked and we decided we were not going to raise Lucian to be this disability. We were going to raise Lucian to live with a disability.Today, at age 7, Lucian is a happy little boy with no signs of self-pity. He walks with his brace and a walker or scoots on the floor. He does chores like his brothers and sister, but in a modified way -- for example, to clean up his room, he takes toys off the floor and puts them in a bag attached to his walker, and then places them back on the shelf.Not wanting to lose the wisdom of the older generation, Olivera arranged for Kurt Sipolski, a polio survivor who wrote a memoir, , to be on the board of a group she created for parents of children with AFM. Sipolski regularly dispenses advice to this new generation of parents whose children live with paralysis.After the meeting, one of the polio survivors knit Lucian a pair of thick woolen socks, since people with paralysis often have cold feet.The socks have become a keepsake for Olivera from a day that changed her life.That meeting reassured me and gave me such insight, she said. They all said polio didn't limit their success. They had careers. They had families. They made me see that Lucian will do those things, too."},

She's been battling cancer, and to survive, she's likely to need blood transfusions from seven to 10 donors who haven't all been found.That's because they're as rare as she is.Only people of Pakistani, Indian or Iranian descent who have the same type of blood as Zainab, whose family hails from Pakistan, are likely to match with her. Less than 4% of people in those populations may match, according to , a South Florida nonprofit organization that's aiding in a global search to identify and recruit donors for the young girl.We have a zero percent chance of finding compatible blood for this little girl if we look in pretty much any other ethnic group, Frieda Bright, a lab manager with OneBlood, said in a video provided by the organization. We are searching the world to try to find blood for this little girl. OneBlood says that ideally, it will be able to locate donors of these ethnicities who live in the United States.A person's blood type is determined by antigens. Zainab's blood is missing an antigen called Indian B, and her body will attack transfused blood that contains it. So, like Zainab, her donors need to be missing the antigen. In addition, they must have type O or A blood. Such donors are extremely rare, said Sandra Nance, senior director of the American Rare Donor Program. Nance said the program tracks at least 59 types of rare blood and has over 120,000 registered donors. She said not a single donor matching Zainab's blood type was registered in the program's US database when the search for matching donors began in September. Since then, two compatible donors in the US and one in the UK have been found, according to OneBlood.Lucky, thank God, they have found three donors. So, so far, she has been going through her normal treatment, her father, Raheel Mughal, said in a video provided by OneBlood. We will definitely need more blood.Zainab's family made the video with OneBlood to call attention to her story. They were unavailable to speak with CNN directly. Zainab's cancer, neuroblastoma, developed in her nerve cells and requires chemotherapy for treatment. She's going to need to be completely supported by blood donations in order to survive the cancer treatment in order to kill this cancer, Bright said. The blood's not going to cure her, but the blood's very, very important to support her while she undergoes the treatment for this particular cancer.Rare blood occurs in less than one in a thousand people, and extremely rare blood can occur in even fewer people, according the American Rare Donor Program. The program, a collaboration between the  and , formerly known as the American Association of Blood Banks, is working with OneBlood to secure more rare blood for Zainab.Rare blood is the blood that you don't have when you need it no matter what, Nance said. If a person has been identified as a rare donor and they're called on to give, my hope is that they will donate, if they are able.In OneBlood video, Mughal made a plea for those who can help. If you are one of those people from the Middle East, please go out and donate blood for my daughter, he said. My daughter's life very much depends on the blood."},
{"title": "For 10 years, a chemical not EPA approved was in their drinking water ", "cate": "health", "content": "For 10 years, some residents in Denmark, South Carolina, have been suspicious of the rust-colored water coming from their taps. They've been collecting samples in jars and using bottled or spring water, even though the local and state government assured them it was safe.But through a Freedom of Information Act request and a one-year investigation, CNN has found new information that may cast doubts on those assurances.The state government was adding a substance to one of the city's four wells, trying to regulate naturally occurring iron bacteria that can leave red stains or rust-like deposits in the water. The substance, known as HaloSan, was not approved by the US Environmental Protection Agency to disinfect drinking water.The city's mayor says that all of the city's wells flow into one system to be distributed throughout the city. The EPA and the state of South Carolina have confirmed to CNN that there is now an open investigation into how this happened, although neither would comment on the target of the probe or the scope. It's unclear what the effects of HaloSan might have been on the almost 3,000 people who live in this rural, tight-knit community, but a group of about 40 residents believe the water is to blame for illnesses and maladies they say they're suffering from. The chemical is typically used as a disinfectant for pools and spas, but several experts contacted by CNN said they could not find another instance where it was added to a drinking water system.One thing is clear -- the state of South Carolina approved its use, and it should not have. It was used for 10 years. CNN was told by the state that it has been adding HaloSan to the water in Denmark since 2008.A spokesman for South Carolina's Department of Health and Environmental Control told CNN in an email that it believed HaloSan was EPA-approved for drinking water based on the way the system was advertised.The Berry Systems HaloSan treatment unit had been advertised as an effective treatment in the control of iron bacteria and was certified ...  said Tommy Crosby, director of media relations for the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control.Berry Systems, the makers of HaloSan, has not responded to multiple phone calls and emails by CNN requesting comment. It was our thinking that it was an approved chemical to be used, said Gerald Wright, mayor of Denmark, South Carolina.  We rely totally on DHEC because they have the responsibility and expertise to test, monitor and advise.An EPA spokesperson tells CNN that HaloSan is not approved to be used to treat drinking water.HaloSan has not undergone the necessary evaluations as part of the pesticide registration process and, therefore, EPA cannot confirm the safe use of this product for the disinfection of drinking water, according to the EPA. An EPA shows that HaloSan can be a significant eye and skin irritant. Other effects can include burning, rash, itching, skin discoloration/redness, blistering, allergic type reactions including hives/welts, allergic contact dermatitis, and bleeding also have been reported. ... Eye pain and swelling of eyes also has been reported in some incidences.Disinfectants fall under the EPA pesticide program. The EPA told CNN that HaloSan is not a registered pesticide product and has not been reviewed by EPA's pesticide program. By law, a product intended to be used to disinfect drinking water must be registered by the Environmental Protection Agency, and have scientific data that demonstrates that the product can perform its intended function without undue harm to people or the environment. The EPA also says that dosage must be regulated when being used for its intended purposes in pesticides. In Denmark's drinking water, it's unclear if it was regulated or filtered. Wright tells CNN that he defers to South Carolina's DHEC. The Berry Systems treatment unit ... was specifically designed to treat the Cox Mill Well at the proper level, the DHEC's Crosby said. He did not say how, or if, the standard for daily monitoring was met. Marc Edwards, a Virginia Tech engineer and researcher who first learned of HaloSan's usage in a sampling report about Denmark, said he was dumbfounded when he saw it was being added to one of Denmark's wells.I did a thorough search, and I've never seen it approved for a public water supply before, he said. And the EPA approvals that I saw, none of them were for municipal potable water.In addition, Edwards noted that he sees no evidence in any reports that the dosage was being regulated.You have to make sure you don't put too much of it in the water. And there was no way that they could prove that they weren't exceeding the recommended dose, he said. There's a maximum allowed amount, even for industrial applications. And they have no way of proving that, that level is not being exceeded. Wilma Subra, a chemist and environmental health scientist, told CNN that HaloSan appears to be sold with a kit that regulates dosage. The state Department of Health and Environmental Control says it required daily monitoring, performed by the certified system operator, of any chemical added to the drinking water, ensuring that the maximum dosage is not exceeded.Joe Charbonnet, science and policy associate at the Green Science Policy Institute, said without knowing the concentration levels in the water, it's hard to know the health effects. He said he is concerned about HaloSan being used as a water disinfectant because it could produce compounds that are toxic.Like many small towns, Denmark's water bills have been rising since its population dropped, along with its revenue. Maintenance of old water lines has fallen victim, leaving pipes to rust and turn the water brown. It's unappealing to look at, evenif the discolored water isn't violating the law. A $2 million federal grant to repair and upgrade water pipes here just wasn't enough, according to Wright, Denmark's mayor. [O]ne grant itself is not adequate to replace all of the necessary pipes. We prioritize the ones that should be replaced first, he told CNN. At no time have we not responded to a need that was urgent. We've done that. So what we've done is all we know we can do. Water is a problem in thousands of towns across the United States. But in Denmark, it's not just the water pipes that are eroding -- so has trust in government officials who claimed the water was properly treated when it apparently was not.Denmark residents Paula Brown and Eugene Smith have been calling for more government oversight since their water tested high for lead in 2010. Subsequent tests were below the legal limit for lead. But, the couple says there have been concerns about skin rashes and kidney problems among residents for years, although a link has not been made directly to the water.Brown calls into the local radio station almost every day in an attempt to warn her neighbors that she doesn't believe the water is safe to drink.How can they say it's good to drink?, Smith told CNN. I'm not gonna drink it, and I know other people drink it, but a lot of people are drinking it because they have no other choice. The couple drives 20 miles roundtrip each month to collect local spring water in cases of gallon jugs and uses that to cook, drink and brush their teeth.In 2016, Brown saw Virginia Tech's Edwards on television, talking about the lead crisis in Flint, Michigan. Edwards has spent nearly two decades testing water and challenging federal, state and local governments on water quality, and his work helped to reveal high levels of lead in Flint's water. Brown picked up the phone and asked him to sample the water in Denmark, too.Edwards took samples at 34 homes and six other locations. Results showed that lead levels were over the legal limit in slightly more than 10 percent of those sampled.  But Edwards says those findings were not high enough above the EPA's action level to sound alarm bells that there was a city-wide problem.However, medical experts say there is no safe level of lead in the body. South Carolina's DHEC tested Brown and Smith's home in 2010, and found about twice the legal level of lead in the water. When it returned to test a few months later, it found levels had dropped below the legal limit. But, in 2011, Eugene Smith, was told by his doctor that the level of lead in his blood was high, and he should avoid his own water.  They are not to be exposed either by ingesting nor skin exposure, reads a medical report that Smith shared with CNN. I was shocked, Smith said. Because I hadn't felt like I had it in me. I got kind of upset and very angry at the time.Documents from his doctor show his blood lead levels were elevated and he says he was diagnosed with partial kidney function. Although he can't say his health problem was caused by the water, he suspects it.But Edwards says he couldn't let go of a nagging feeling that there was something missing, especially after finding red flags, like a 2010  where a city official declared the water had safe lead levels nine days before the testing was conducted. Wright, Denmark's mayor, later told CNN that officials were relying on 3-year-old data when talking to the newspaper because that was what was available at the time.Skeptical of the town's transparency, Edwards decided to request to test the town's water at its source -- the drinking water wells -- for certain bacteria that might be causing some of the rashes and illness that residents described.Wright wavered, and eventually, Edwards says he was denied access to the wells. Wright said he had no reason to prevent Edwards from sampling. He said the state was required to do its own testing.I told him I thought it would be a waste of his time and resources to get the same samples, he told CNN. I guess you have to decide if you gonna believe him or believe me.Instead, the mayor allowed a team from the University of South Carolina to accompany state testers at the well sites, and the resulting report revealed that HaloSan was being added to the drinking water supply at one of the four wells. After Edwards began asking questions, the state was ordered by Clemson University, which oversees pesticide registration in South Carolina, to stop adding HaloSan to the water. The well remains offline and is not in use. I mean it has stopped, but what the effects that did to people who been using this water through and through? Eugene Smith said. I'm real kind of upset. People won't know until they go get tested and find what's happened to your body. Oh my god.Denmark's mayor told CNN he believes he has done everything to make sure the water is safe.I live here, he said. I use water every day. Drink it. Washing in it. I would be extremely foolish if I didn't make certain it was safe. I care about myself as much as anybody cares about themselves. We have not been derelict or negligent with anything related to water. Those persons complaining, you will find out they are bogus complaints. We don't have any reason at all to provide anything less than quality water. A group of about 40 residents, including Smith and Brown, are now considering litigation, claiming they've been harmed by the water. They've hired Charleston, South Carolina, attorney John Harrell to represent them.   Harrell tells CNN one of his clients, a 12-year-old, had to have her gall bladder removed because she had 4,000 stones in it, and another 15-year-old client had so many bladder-related illnesses that she had to have her bladder removed. There are so many residents that have been diagnosed with kidney dysfunction. I am convinced that there is some serious contamination, he said. South Carolina's Department of Health and Environmental Control, when asked about the potential litigation, said it would be inappropriate to comment."},
{"title": "#JUUL: How social media hyped nicotine for a new generation", "cate": "health", "content": "Leading e-cigarette company Juul Labs has tried to distance itself from a vast social media presence that experts say drives its popularity among teens. But a CNN investigation sheds new light on how the company was encouraging -- and at times paying for -- social media users to promote its nicotine-filled product to thousands of their followers.One of these users was Brooklyn-based Christina Zayas, 36, who has made a full-time career out of being a social media influencer since 2015: reviewing products, posing for photos and injecting her own brand of style and whimsy into her  posts.Brands were eventually saying, 'We have a budget. Would you be interested in doing this for money?'  Zayas told CNN.In September 2017, she was invited to a campaign featuring Juul. The email, which she shared with CNN, came from an influencer marketing firm called Lumanu, with which she'd worked on other social media campaigns. A representative asked her to try Juul's premium e-cigarette and share your experience on your blog, saying it was an opportunity to work together over several months.They liked my edgy style and that I appealed to the younger market, Zayas said.Zayas, who had been an occasional cigarette smoker, hadn't had a good experience with e-cigarettes in the past but found the Juul easier to use, and she liked the flavors. She had tried it a week before Lumanu contacted her -- coincidentally, she said.When Juul reached out to me at first, I was a little hesitant because even though it's my brand, I do what I want with it, she added. Am I going to get backlash because I'm talking about smoking?After the campaign, she was paid $1,000 for one  post and one Instagram post, she said. The Instagram post from November 2017 reached more than 4,500 people and garnered roughly 1,500 likes, according to metrics she shared with CNN.The response was positive. This sounds fun, one user commented. You make smoking look so good, wrote another.Health experts have slammed the company's marketing tactics as following in the footsteps of Big Tobacco, which aimed advertising at young people in an effort to gain lifelong customers. Now, in the era of social media and its heavy teen presence, those same experts worry that e-cigarettes could put kids' developing brains at risk, get them hooked on nicotine early in life and be a gateway to smoking and Juul Labs spokeswoman Victoria Davis told CNN in an emailed statement that it ended its influencer program earlier this year. She added that the paid influencer program, which was never formalized, was short-lived and involved fewer than 10 paid influencers, who were all smokers or former smokers 28 and up, and who were collectively paid less than $10,000.Davis said that the influencers had age appropriate audiences (21+). Zayas, whose posts are publicly visible, shared with CNN that 5% of her current Instagram audience are 13 to 17, though the majority are 18 to 35.An application  inviting users to Join the JUUL Influencers is no longer active, Davis said, and the initiative is not moving forward.Juul also had an affiliate program, which offered commissions for purchases made through referral links on websites and social media. Davis said that program included less than 20 active affiliates as of September 2018, the month before it ended.The company ended that program on October 31, according to an  shared with CNN by Vapor Vanity, a website that posts reviews and information about e-cigarettes. In the email, a member of Juul's affiliate marketing team said that the program was on hold indefinitely until further notice and that the company would continue to evaluate the program.Though Davis said the influencer and affiliate programs were small, critics argue that the even small amounts of Juul-related content are able to spread widely on the internet.Social media works differently than other stuff. You don't need that many people, said Matthew L. Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. A small number of people who are popular and get reposted can reach a very large number of people.For example, a  in May found that seven Instagram accounts posting droves of Juul-related content, only one of which belonged to the company, collectively had amassed over a quarter million followers. The other six accounts, which were later removed, were created by a commercial entity that would benefit from higher sales of JUUL, said study author Jidong Huang, associate professor at Georgia State University's School of Public Health. Davis said none of the accounts in the study were part of Juul's affiliate program. And Juul worked with social media platforms to get these accounts taken down, she added.In June, Juul said in a  that it has a dedicated internal team focused on reporting inappropriate content to social media companies, such as third-party accounts that use the Juul name to sell products to underage users. In addition, Davis noted that the company had  much of its US-based social media, shutting down its Facebook and Instagram feeds in November and scaling back its use of Twitter and YouTube.Dr. Robert Jackler, founder of the , told CNN it's a good thing that the company had cut down its social media in the US.However, it's very late in the game, he said.Vaping increased  among high schoolers and 50% among middle schoolers since last year, according to the US Food and Drug Administration. This prompted the agency last month to propose  on flavored nicotine products that have propelled the rise.Another report  announced similar findings: Vaping nicotine products nearly doubled among high schoolers, with more than one in five seniors saying they've done so in the past month.Juul Labs, which holds about 75% of the e-cigarette market in the United States, has come under increasing scrutiny by public health experts and the FDA, whose commissioner, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, recently warned of the  of e-cigarette use among teenagers.Much of this scrutiny has focused on the company's marketing, which has been front and center in lawsuits and other  into whether Juul targeted teens. Part of that marketing effort included paying influencers to post about the device.Zayas was not the only influencer posting about Juul. CNN found personalized links tied to Zayas and other influencers that referenced Lumanu, which Davis said Juul hired for potential content engagement strategies.These URLs -- which contain the terms source=lumanu and campaign=juul_influencer -- can be used by Lumanu to track how many people click on those links. Lumanu did not respond to CNN's requests for comment.Another of those links came from Laura Ellner, an influencer for the past 10 years. She told CNN that her  and social media are a side project, an opportunity to partner with brands she likes and get paid for it. She had also worked with Lumanu in the past, and the agency approached her again in September 2017, she said.They asked if I knew about Juul, and I literally had one in my mouth, said Ellner, 31, who started smoking cigarettes at 16, when her rebellious phase coincided with Camel's pi\u00f1a colada flavor, which is no longer available in the US.Ellner said Lumanu sent her some talking points, directions and guidelines to follow -- nothing that made me feel uncomfortable, she offered. She felt that she had creative control over her own content, which the company approved. On her , Ellner praised the device as an intensely satisfying vapor alternative designed for adult smokers whose elegant design matches up pretty much perfectly with whatever I'm wearing.She declined to tell CNN how much she was paid, but she stands by her work -- and doesn't believe that Juul targeted teenagers. Teenagers are going to be teenagers, Ellner said. Are we ever going to be able to stop kids from doing things they are not supposed to?Jackler said he doesn't necessarily believe Juul intentionally targeted underaged kids in its marketing, but its appeal to kids was obvious early on, and the company didn't take early steps to prevent that.The company claims that they didn't know that the product appealed to underage kids who began using it in large numbers, Jackler said.I don't believe that, not for a minute, because they're also a very digital, very analytical company, he added. They know their market. They know what they're doing.The company engaged with social media users in other ways, commenting on posts, offering discounts on products, using popular hashtags and reposting photos of Juuls taken by other users. In one instance this year, CNN found that Juul's Instagram reposted a photo of a Juul in an outstretched hand taken by a 17-year-old, tagging him in the description. He was not a paid influencer, but the company's official account still follows him.Davis said the company was not aware of this. And if we were aware, we would never have re-posted the image per our social media guidelines, she added. The company's  says, We only share user generated social media content that does not feature underage users.Jackler said the company professed over and over that they weren't interested in targeting [underage] people, when in fact their way of promoting their product had great appeal to young people and caused a market fervor.According to one , the number of JUUL-related tweets exploded in 2017 ... 17 times the 2016 levels. Another  this year estimated that 25% of users retweeting the company were under 18.The bulk of this content is not sponsored, experts say. Some social media content creators told CNN they posted Juul content in an effort to gain followers through a trend or because they genuinely believed in the product.Still, Juul has deleted much of its old social media in waves -- an effort to stop underage use, it says. But many of its posts are still archived by the Stanford research group, which CNN reviewed.We do not feature images or situations intended for a youth audience, Juul's marketing and  We ensure responsible placement of our product designed to limit exposure to an underage demographic.Ashley Gould, chief administrative officer at Juul Labs, told CNN in June that the company has also been working to remove outside social media content created by or aimed at youth. The company has maintained that its product is intended to convert adult former smokers to what Juul describes as a less-harmful alternative.We were completely surprised by the youth usage of the product, she told CNN.One of the scary things about social media is that it doesn't take a lot of money, said Myers, whose anti-tobacco advocacy group has documented Juul's marketing efforts. And if you hit the right people doing it, then it just takes off.Juul representatives say the company has played a minimal role in the vast amount of Juul-related content online.In the company's November  against underage vaping, CEO Kevin Burns said, More than 99 percent of all social media content related to JUUL Labs is generated through third-party users and accounts with no affiliation to our company.There is no question that this user-generated social media content is linked to the appeal of vaping to underage users, he added.We have done very little marketing relative to our growth, Matt David, the company's chief communications officer, said in a  in July in response to an investigation by the Massachusetts attorney general probing whether Juul had targeted minors.Another Juul spokeswoman, Christine Castro, told  in April that the company had no control over promotional content by other people and companies. That is completely separate from us, she said.CEO Burns told the  in May, We have frustrations about how the product is glorified on social media.When Zayas was contacted by Lumanu, she said she wanted to write honestly about her personal journey with sobriety. She had been an on-and-off smoker, but when she got sober, not having a vice, I leaned on cigarettes again, she said. Juul seemed to be another option. But according to Zayas, the company didn't want her writing about her struggle with alcohol.They didn't want me talking about sobriety, Zayas said. They wanted me to talk about the product, the shape of the device and how cool it was.They just wanted me to create lifestyle content.She said she doesn't regret participating in the social media campaign when she did, because it reflected a product she was using in her daily life. But when an influencer marketing manager approached her in January 2018 to be part of a video testimonial campaign, she had stopped vaping and turned down the offer, she said.The company  in June that it would no longer use models on social media platforms, instead focusing on testimonials from adult smokers who switched to Juul.At least one of those ex-smokers was former Juul Influencer Ellner. She met the Juul team in San Francisco as she was moving there and ended up doing two shoots, which she said were unpaid and separate from the influencer campaign.Another testimonial also features actress and rapper Awkwafina, identified in the title only by her first name, Nora. In a  posted in May, the performer -- who appeared this year in Crazy Rich Asians and Ocean's 8 -- talked about her switch from cigarettes to Juul. The video was shared on the company's official Twitter as late as August in a now-deleted post and remains on YouTube. Representatives for Awkwafina and Juul said she did not receive financial compensation for the Juul campaign.Neither Ellner nor Awkwafina is listed on Juul's community page of former smokers' testimonials.Jackler said the company's current marketing strategy is nowhere close to where it began. Before the current campaign focusing on switching former smokers, the company's marketing was manifestly youth-oriented, Jackler said.It showed 20-something models dressed in fashionably casual clothing, he added. They're the exact kind of young adults that teenagers find appealing and wish to aspire and be like.Many ads emphasized fruity flavors and sometimes oozed with sex appeal, experts say. Old job listings suggest the pursuit of social media influencers goes back those early days, as well. Around that time, PAX Labs -- the company that would later give rise to Juul Labs -- sought an influencer marketing intern who would court influencers and encourage favorable content about the product on social media.Social media was just one part of the puzzle. Juul's launch campaign, Vaporized, threw  and  across the country -- at least 25, according to the Stanford archive. Photos of the events show DJ booths, Juul-branded beer cozies and  product display cases labeled with  and  Attendees at one event could step into a photo booth and create animated We created ridiculous enthusiasm for the hashtag 'Vaporized,'  marketing agency Cult Collective said in its Juul  The company said its campaign aligned perfectly with those we knew would be our best customers.Thousands of free  were handed out at these events, including starter kits, until the FDA  free samples of vaping products in 2016. After that, attendees were charged $1 to sample products at tasting events in Miami and New York. (These events were not open to those under 21, according to event ads.)Their business model is to get the devices in people's hands because the way they make their money is through ... selling the nicotine-rich Juul pods over and over to customers, Jackler said.In June, Gould told CNN that the company took criticism of its 2015 launch campaign seriously. That campaign in the end, we felt, did not help us achieve our mission of speaking to adult smokers to provide them information about an alternative to cigarettes, she said.Some advocates say Juul's marketing and social media response is too little, too late. Once you get kids doing it, you don't have to pay for it, Myers said. It takes off on its own, and you continue to get the financial benefit.It is 10 times dropping a rock in a still pond; the ripple just keeps going.Jackler agreed, saying that the company fostered a social media phenomenon that took on a life of its own -- and continues to introduce young people to its product.Hashtag-Juul lives on, he said.A few years ago, Zayas worked at an influencer agency similar to Lumanu, called Socialyte, where she managed other bloggers. She was the liaison between influencers and brands, negotiating rates and the sponsored content, she said.Brands will often reach out to influencers like her multiple times if a campaign does well, she said.And this can be big business, according to Kevin Popovic, director of the Idea Lab at San Diego State University and founder of Ideahaus, a creative communications agency.When looking for influencers to promote their products, companies scour the internet to find popular people and websites whose audiences the brand hopes to connect with, he said. It's a tactic that most PR agencies have used for years, Popovic said, contacting people of a certain influence in order to shape the market perception of a brand or product.You have to realize that the only reason people want to do business with you is because they think you have something they want, he said.Unlike other media such as print or television, social media offer companies detailed information on the efficacy of their campaigns. Many times, we'll give influencers a unique URL that has tracking abilities on it, Popovic said, allowing companies to better assess the return on investment.But critics think it's inappropriate to apply those high-tech marketing techniques to a substance like nicotine.They're not selling widgets, Myers said. They're selling a highly addictive product.Since August, the FDA has required e-cigarette manufactures to include highly visible  on packaging and advertising -- including on social media -- that state just that: This product contains nicotine. Nicotine is an addictive chemical.Myers said Juul has followed Big Tobacco's playbook: A two-year  led by the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids found that cigarette companies were paying influencers to post pictures that glamorized smoking. The investigation, released in August, also found that companies guided influencers on how to take photos, what hashtags to include and when to post them to increase their visibility. These campaigns reached more than 40 countries worldwide. When asked whether Juul was ceasing any influencer programs in other countries and about its social media channels that remain active abroad, Juul spokeswoman Davis said, Each country has unique rules and obligations when it comes to these types of activities, and we will assess the regulations for each country to see what might be appropriate.The notion that young people are that different ... it's inconsistent with the evidence, Myers said. The kind of imagery they were using in social media appeals to young people in country after country.It's exactly what we showed the cigarette companies we're doing.Social media and advertising are not the only reasons Juul has been accused of targeting kids. This year, the company abandoned efforts to roll out an anti-vaping curriculum in schools, offering school districts thousands of dollars and new technologies to implement it, a  showed. The company halted the program following a backlash from health and education advocates. We stopped distribution in response to feedback from those who thought our efforts were being misunderstood, Davis previously told CNN, describing the effort as a short-lived initiative designed to provide educators with current information on vaping products in general to supplement existing tobacco prevention education.Last month, FDA Commissioner Gottlieb proposed to strengthen the agency's  against flavored e-cigarette products, which could ultimately prompt their removal from shelves and websites that are accessible to minors.The proposed changes do not include mint, menthol and tobacco flavors, however. Gottlieb said he wanted to leave the door open for adults who might use these products to quit smoking cigarettes, but it can't come at the expense of addicting a generation of kids on nicotine, he told CNN last month. Two days before the FDA announcement, on November 13, Juul vowed to halt most  of flavor products while restricting flavor sales to adults 21 and older on its secure website.The FDA proposals come as the agency has expanded its investigation into e-cigarette companies,  to 21 companies in October -- including Juul -- in an effort to uncover whether they are marketing products illegally and outside the agency's compliance policy.Less than two weeks earlier, the agency conducted a  of Juul's corporate headquarters in San Francisco, seizing thousands of documents, many of which relate to its sales and marketing practices. The FDA has not released the findings of the inspection.The agency also plans to hold a  to debate whether to approve smoking cessation drugs for kids in order to get them off of e-cigarettes. The hearing was scheduled for December 5 but was postponed due to the funeral of former President George H.W. Bush, the FDA said.Myers said, The FDA has concluded that the level of addiction it is seeing among youthful e-cigarette users is so disturbing and so unprecedented that it needs to at least ask whether we need a solution that goes beyond what we ever did with cigarettes.When it comes to vaping among adults, consumers and health experts have been locked in a contentious debate: Some see it as a smoking cessation tool for adults, but others say there's no good evidence to support this.Gould, Juul's chief administrative officer, told CNN, Juul is a switching product, not a cessation product, and it is intended for adult smokers to enable them to switch from combustible cigarettes.Ellner says she's still a fan of the device and feels like Juul's uptake among kids is affecting a business that had other [positive] intentions.It's a bummer, she said.Zayas, however, stopped vaping because she felt sick, and she had migraines and anxiety. She felt that she was becoming addicted to Juul pods -- each of which contains the same amount of nicotine as a pack of , experts say.I was getting physically sick. Every time I put it down, I would pick it back up, Zayas said. As someone who suffers from addiction, it just wasn't a good idea for me to smoke the Juul.I still wake up every morning craving the Juul, but they are less and less each day.CNN's Christina Zdanowicz and Ben Tinker contributed to this report."},
{"title": "Retired FDA research monkeys find new home and music in Florida", "cate": "health", "content": "Squirrel monkey chirps filled a small ranch-style building in north Gainesville, Florida -- a chorus that made Kari Bagnall's smile swell even wider.She covered her grin with a medical mask, calmly walked to the middle of a climate-controlled room and greeted each of the 26 monkeys. There were about three toeach large cage.Poppit and Pixel jumped over each other when Kari passed by. Gizmo looked up with wide eyes. Pip let out a tiny chirp. Then there was Oak. Despite pain from rheumatoid arthritis, his energy was about as high as the others'.Bagnall stopped interacting with the other monkeys to look directly at him. She squinted, homed in on his hands and then shifted her shoulders back with satisfaction.He looks good, she said. Oak and the other monkeys arrived in mid-November at Jungle Friends, this primate sanctuary in Gainesville where . The monkeys were once involved in a US Food and Drug Administration study intended to investigate the role of various levels of nicotine in the onset of addiction in teens and young adults.In January, after the deaths of four monkeys involved in the research drew criticism from some animal rights activists, the agency ended the study. The 26 remaining monkeys were retired to Jungle Friends, and the FDA quickly established an  to oversee all animal research under the agency's purview., founded in 1996, is home to more than 300 new world monkeys and has been asked to take in hundreds of  over the years. The squirrel monkeys are the latest arrivals.The , or , typically can be found in the tropical forests of Central and South America, roaming from Costa Rica through central Brazil and Bolivia. These monkeys typically have a life span of about 20 years. The males weigh between 1.22 and 2.53 pounds on average, and the females average between 1.43 and 2.76 pounds. When the monkeys arrived, Bagnall said, they all looked gorgeous and healthy, needing no serious medical care -- except for Oak, who the FDA had told the sanctuary had a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis and was receiving treatment. Bagnall thanked the FDA for releasing the monkeys to her sanctuary's care.The most special thing about these particular monkeys is that they came out of the FDA, which has not released monkeys out of research in the past -- and we are so happy that now the FDA is opting to retire monkeys after the research has ended. They didn't have to do this, Bagnall said.All of these monkeys were born inside, she said. They've never been outside. So they've never felt the sun on their face or the grass under their feet or rain or wind. It's all going to be such a new experience for them, and they're all just so different and individual. They'll all react differently.For now, the monkeys are being kept indoors until spring, when they will be introduced to their new outdoor environment.The monkeys used in the nicotine addiction study are just a sliver of a larger debate around medical research on animals.In the United States, 75,825 non-human primates were used in experiments at animal research facilities last year; an additional 34,369 were held in facilities but not used for study, according to the .The  when it comes to animal research, with 52% opposing the practice and 47% in support of it, according to a  released in August.As for the FDA's latest decision, animal rights activists celebrated the monkeys' arrival at their new retirement home in Florida. Some scientists questioned what the move could mean for the future of medical research.Matthew Bailey, president of the Foundation for Biomedical Research, said in Januarythat undoubtedly, some will argue that this recent action by the FDA is a reason to end research with animal models. But given the inextricable role humane and responsible animal research plays in the health of the overall population, and the health of the animals about which we care so deeply, that is a very dangerous proposition.Animals played a role in the development of each of the in America, he said, adding that pets, farm animals and wildlife benefit from medical treatments developed in part from animal research.Farm animals and wildlife are routinely vaccinated against any number of diseases, but those vaccines wouldn't be available without animal research, he said. If you love animals, you really should support animal research.While visiting Jungle Friends last week, Justin Goodman, vice president of advocacy and public policy for the taxpayer watchdog group White Coat Waste Project, said that technologies, including computer models, could replace animal models in research.The truth is that, for scientific, ethical and economic reasons, animal experimentation is incredibly wasteful and needs to go the way of the dinosaur, he said. Technologies that replace the use of animals are more effective.When lab animals retire at sanctuaries, most people assume that they are immediately released outdoors to run free.That's not often the case, Bagnall said, adding that a gradual introduction to the outdoors seems to benefit the animals more.You would think 'Oh, we're going to give them all this space and be outside,' but sometimes they're a little nervous about that, and they've never been outside, Bagnall said.For the 26 squirrel monkeys, including Oak, Bagnall and her team are introducing them to the outdoors gradually by putting elements they will encounter -- such as banana leaves, bamboo, or pine straw -- in the monkeys' cages.So they get used to what things feel like and look like and smell like first, Bagnall said.It's a gradual process, and it will probably take four to five months, she said. Then they're going to be released into their outdoor habitats.Another reason the monkeys are not being released immediately to the outdoors is because of the cold winter weather, she added, and in the spring, they can adjust to the new climate.Meanwhile, all of the monkeys undergo routine medical evaluations, with Oak requiring more specialized care.Oak, who is 5 years old, has puzzled the Jungle Friends care team with his rheumatoid arthritis diagnosis, said Dr. Bobby Collins, a retired veterinarian who once oversaw the welfare of research animals in academic settings and now volunteers at Jungle Friends. This is unusual, said Collins, who has been treating Oak. Because you just don't see squirrel monkeys or non-human primates having rheumatoid arthritis. It's not diagnosed very frequently, and this is a young animal. Most of the time, if you're going to see it in animals, it's older animals, where they've got chronic inflammation.Oak has been treated with immunosuppressive drugs, and his care team plans to discuss his health with experts at the University of Florida to better understand his medical problem and needs.The kind of disease that this guy has, it flares up, and he obviously has discomfort and some pain associated with it. It alters how we house the animal and let him interact with the other animals, Collins said.That social interaction for non-human primates is so important. You can see these guys get depressed when they're deprived of contact with other animals their own species, he said. So we want to try to remove those flareups or minimize them so he can, again, interact with monkeys and be a monkey.On Wednesday afternoon, the monkeys had a music hour and listened to the soundtrack of Forrest Gump while playing in their cages.Oak sipped from an in-cage water bottle before nestling into a corner with his tail curled over his shoulder. Joy to the World by Three Dog Night sang out across the room: Joy to the fishes in the deep blue sea, joy to you and me.In that moment, Oak appeared relaxed.The saga of Oak and the other squirrel monkeys began in 2014.That year, the FDA's National Center for Toxicological Research conducted a study to examine the behavioral and biological effects of nicotine in squirrel monkeys. The research was an effort to better understand how reducing nicotine levels would impact them, and ultimately to better understand how it affects humans.After learning about the study, White Coat Waste Project, an advocacy group working to stop taxpayer-funded animal research, filed a Freedom of Information Act request for materials related to that research. The group claimed that the response it received didn't comply with its request, and in August 2017, .About a month later, world-renowned primatologist  to FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb noting that she was disturbed and shocked to learn that the agency was still performing nicotine addiction experiments on monkeys.Soon after, , writing, After learning of concerns related to the study you referenced, I directed the agency to place a hold on the research study earlier this month. Accordingly, at this time, all experimentation involving the monkeys in the study you referenced has been halted.Because the study was terminated prior to completion, behavioral data from the research is incomplete, FDA spokeswoman Tara Rabin wrote in an email Monday. If the study had been completed, the FDA still would have considered moving the monkeys to a sanctuary, she wrote. In light of the decision to halt the study, the FDA currently has no plans to conduct additional squirrel monkey research.According to , animals are sometimes used in the testing of drugs, vaccines and other biologics, and medical devices, mainly to determine the safety of these medical products. When animal testing is done, manufacturers or sponsors are required to follow the FDA's regulation . The agency also supports the use of , federally mandated under the , and the Health Research Extension Act to provide oversight for most institutions using animals in research.In January, Rabin wrote in a separate email that individual animal care committees are tasked with study-specific oversight, but the newly established Animal Welfare Council will track all studies across the FDA and provide centralized oversight and coordination of all animal research activities and facilities under the agency's purview. This Council will advise on the agency's approach to animal welfare issues and ensure alignment of animal studies with the agency's mission.Additionally, in November, the  aimed at finding ways in which drug developers could conduct certain types of research without dogs, in an effort to .This is another example of our efforts to reduce animal research, FDA spokeswoman Nina Devlin wrote in an email Saturday.The FDA has also taken steps to develop and use other research models that don't involve animals, Rabin said Monday, including forming  to accelerate adopting modeling and simulation tools. These are just some of the many FDA initiatives underway to reduce reliance on animal-based studies, while still helping to ensure that Americans have access to safe, reliable and effective medical products and safe food, she wrote.Some politicians applauded the FDA's decision to terminate its nicotine study and establish a council to review future animal research.I'm proud that a Florida sanctuary stepped up to give these monkeys a home, Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz said in a statement Friday. There's still much more work to be done to stop the government's monkey business in labs at the FDA and other agencies.As music hour at Jungle Friends wound downon Wednesday, The Youngbloods crooned, Come on people now, smile on your brother.Poppit and Pixel hopped over each other from one end of their cage to the other. Gizmo swung from a red barrel. Oak curled up calmly.Everybody get together, try to love one another, right now.For now, the squirrel monkeys will continue to chirp and play in that small ranch-style building in Gainesville until it's finally time to go outside."},
{"title": "The impact homelessness and the opioid crisis are having on San Francisco streets", "cate": "health", "content": "Outside the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in downtown San Francisco, a woman urinates on the sidewalk and smokes a crack pipe.Inside her purse are about a dozen used heroin needles. She shoots heroin up to 10 times per day, she says.About 50 yards away, a man injects another woman in the neck with a needle. She puts her thumb in her mouth and blows on it to make her vein more visible. Her right arm is caked with dried blood.This San Francisco neighborhood is home to the headquarters of Uber, Twitter and Salesforce. But stroll around here, and you're also likely to find used drug paraphernalia, trash, and human excrement on the sidewalks, and people lying in various states of consciousness.Public drug usage and homelessness are not new problems for the city of San Francisco. But residents say the situation has gotten worse in recent years. As of October, 7,500 complaints about discarded needles have been made this year, compared with 6,363 last year. In 2015, the number was less than 3,000.It's moved some locals -- so-called video vigilantes -- to document the mess they see, in an attempt to get the city's attention.Adam Mesnick, a restaurateur who lives and works in the South of Market (SoMa) neighborhood, started posting daily photos and videos of people using drugs in public, urinating near his restaurant, or lying passed out on the sidewalk.More mrsa and staph on the streets of San Francisco, Mesnick wrote in one post, accompanied by photos of angry sores on people's backs, hands and legs.One photo shows a man planted face down on the sidewalk, his shorts pulled down exposing his rear. In another, human feces lies nestled in front of a doorway. In a video apparently taken from inside Mesnick's restaurant, a man can be seen urinating in a doorway across the street.Mesnick isn't trying to shame homeless people with his Twitter posts, he says, but to actually find help for these people. He's been giving leftover food from his restaurant to the homeless for the past ten years, he said.Over the past five or six years, Mesnick says, visible homelessness and drug use on the streets have seemed to spread from areas of San Francisco where they were once concentrated, like the Tenderloin.It's like third world squalor, Mesnick said. I'm a small business (owner) trying to exist, and basically surrounded by decay that continues to get worse and worse and worse.Others fear that the situation will impact tourism. If we can't find a solution to this problem, said Joe D'Alessandro, CEO of the San Francisco Convention and Visitors Bureau, it will tarnish the city's brand.Another longtime resident tweets about the state of the neighborhood using the handle @cleanupwestsoma. He asked to remain anonymous because his friends don't know he runs the account, and says he's lived in San Francisco for 21 years, 12 of them in SoMa.I post as I go to work. I'll sometimes come home from lunch and see a giant drug deal going on, he said. I'll leave and go back to work and see someone going to the bathroom in the street. It blows me away that this continues to happen in the city.Mesnick and @cleanupwestsoma want to send a message to city officials about what's happening in their neighborhoods. They often tweet at San Francisco Mayor London Breed, who took office in a special election in July after the death of Mayor Ed Lee.You know what? I already had the message, as a native San Franciscan, as someone who's been here all my life, Breed told CNN. It isn't acceptable.Breed, 44, made tackling homelessness and drug addiction a signature of her campaign platform. She says the city has been making changes since she took office, and that they're slowly starting to have an impact. It's not an unsolvable problem, she said.Last week, the mayor announced a detailed plan to direct a  the city received from the state to homelessness, affordable housing and related problems. The proposal includes nearly $20 million to be spent on beds for patients who have addiction and mental health problems. An additional $4 million would go toward expanding street cleaning. And Breed says visible progress has already been made.If you walk with me right now, you will see the difference, she said. You'll see more police officers. You'll see the homeless outreach team. You'll see people power-washing on a regular basis and picking up trash. Tent encampments are down by 27% since she took office, she said.Kevin Schwing, who works in SoMa, said that despite the city's efforts, he doesn't see a change in the numbers of people on the streets.I don't really know what the city can do, he said. The city cleans up sidewalks every day. But I don't see any difference in terms of the amount of people.I see human waste. Injections. Probably 10 times per day, he said. Sometimes people look like they're dead.Breed says the city is cracking down on drug dealing, and aims to open at least 1,000 new shelter beds by the end of 2020.And she's looking at new ways to approach these entrenched problems, she says. Breed supports safe injection sites -- facilities where people can inject heroin in a private setting and under the supervision of health care workers. The sites would not only be a way to get people off the streets and get the needles off the streets, but to get people into treatment, Breed said. California Gov. Jerry Brown  earlier this year that would have allowed safe injection sites in the state.She also supports conservatorship programs for the severely mentally ill, which would allow the state to make decisions for them in order to place them into mental health stabilization beds, instead of our criminal justice system. Gov. Brown recently signed a bill that would allow such action to take place.Breed says she hopes the video vigilantes tag 311, the city's non-emergency complaint service center, in their posts. The information they're putting out helps the city address challenges in specific neighborhoods, she said.The city's Department of Public Health recently partnered with the San Francisco AIDS Foundation, essentially hiring contract workers to fan the streets and collect used needles.Crisis intervention teams have also stepped up their efforts to provide addicts with the drug buprenorphine, a narcotic to help reduce a person's addiction to heroin and other opioids.We go to people that are using drugs and offer them treatment instead of the traditional model which has people coming into a clinic, said Dr. Naveena Bobba, the department's deputy director of health.The city has also launched the so-called poop patrol, a team that responds to complaints of feces on city streets.SoMa resident Alesia Panajota said she sees an impact. They're doing the best they can, she said. I think things are getting better under London Breed.San Francisco may also see an influx of cash to help solve the crisis, after a controversial ballot measure passed in November. Known as Prop C, the measure is viewed as a homeless tax -- it aims to raise $300 million a year to spend on homeless services by taxing big businesses.Salesforce Chairman and Co-CEO Marc Benioff spent at least $7 million of his own money to help ensure Prop C's passage. We have to say enough is enough, he recently told CNN.But legal challenges could prevent the city from receiving the funds for several years.In the meantime, Mesnick keeps posting. He recently put up a video interview with a homeless man talking about how difficult it is to find a place to go to the bathroom after dark.Help this guy, Mesnick wrote. Keep the restrooms open at night? Perhaps we change usage of our space and make it a bathroom share? Better than on our front stoop...We are in a severe epidemic here, he told CNN. My angle may seem to be a little rough around the edges, but it's really about compassion."},
{"title": "For parents of separated twins, inspiration and heartache ", "cate": "health", "content": "Jadon McDonald studies the picture book and reads the words aloud: my, he, she, the. He pours on the charm, using a deep-throated caveman voice and flashing a huge smile after each word. Within moments, he announces that he wants to walk. He spins from the coffee table, grabs his walker and scoots across the living room. His twin brother, Anias, sits nearby in a specially designed wheelchair, playing with a soft keyboard he can touch with his feet. His movements are more restrictive, his mobility more limited, his speech more strained. The boys, born joined at the head, once had to do everything together. Now 3 years old, they're learning to navigate the world apart.  The difference in their progress isn't lost on their parents, Nicole and Christian McDonald. It's part of their everyday reality, but one they view with optimism.Jadon is like personality with feet, Nicole said; Anias is the blank canvas waiting to turn into a masterpiece.He is a child without limits, she said. Christian says Anias is equally remarkable, simply operating at a different pace. In this day and age, we're kind of a quantum leap society -- you know, we want quick fixes, he said. Anias can do amazing things and will do amazing things. But it's not just a quantum leap. It's something that's going to happen gradually.Jadon and Anias captivated millions around the world when they underwent a 27-hour separation surgery in October 2016 at the Children's Hospital at Montefiore Medical Center in New York.  The twins, who were 13 months old at the time, shared a 5-by-7-centimeter section of brain tissue. Studies have shown that 80% of these so-called craniopagus twins die of medical complications by the age of 2 if they are not separated. The boys' parents let CNN exclusively into their lives, to follow them through the marathon surgery and recovery, culminating in a documentary, Separated: Saving the Twins.The McDonalds were faced with an unimaginable choice: separate the boys and enter a world of unknowns or keep them together and likely watch them deteriorate and die. Christian says they undoubtedly made the right choice. If that's what the boys needed, then that's what we were going to do, he said. We were going to give them their best shot, and we feel like we did that.We feel like our faith and our belief definitely carried us through.Added Nicole, when we decided to share our story with the world, I did it with the intention of knowing that everyone would see a miracle.The miracle of the boys seeing each other apart for the first time; of Mom and Dad holding their babies individually; of seeing the boys sleep in separate beds. Nicole still fights back tears remembering those moments: You always have to look at every single decision you make for both children and hope that the one that you made is the best thing that you did for them individually, because you are in charge of their life. Before the surgery, any time the parents needed to move the boys, they had to carry them together in a carefully choreographed way. Nicole and Christian transported their lives from their Midwestern roots to the Bronx in 2016 to be close to the medical staff at Montefiore in preparation for the surgery. The entire journey has been surreal, Nicole said.After the operation, while the boys were undergoing rehab, the family moved to a home in upstate New York that Christian had renovated. About four months ago, desperate to be near relatives and longing for small-town life again, they moved to Indiana.They picked a home on about 2 acres of land, down rural country roads and tucked between cornfields. They wanted a spot to give the family space, to let the boys grow and prosper and to allow their older brother, Aza, 5, to thrive on his own. I had reached a point where I couldn't do it anymore, Nicole said. I needed my mom. I needed just anyone who could come in my house and help me, because it was getting too hard.I needed to go home. The boys needed it, and Aza needed it.All of that is on display as Aza flies around the house, hiding soft rubber letters for Jadon to pick up as if on a scavenger hunt. Jadon and Aza even ride the school bus together to attend day care.   Jadon and Aza are both in school, and Anias goes to preschool one day a week, Christian said. So we're trying to be a normal family.When twins are joined at the head, one tends to be more dominant. In this case, Jadon was the dominant one, whose body worked overtime to keep both of them alive. Post-surgery, Anias has struggled more with breathing and an array of other issues. He used a breathing machine to keep him alive and other equipment was hooked up to him to monitor his vitals. Anias faced major setbacks over the past year. He stopped rolling. He stopped playing with toys. He stopped lifting his head because so much fluid had built around his brain it weighed him down. It was horrific for me to watch, Nicole says. Anias had not just stopped development, but regressed in development. He also developed eczema so bad, his mother says, his legs and ankles were like raw meat. He started having seizures so severe that he'd turn blue up to 15 times a day. I thought I was losing him forever, and I was devastated, Nicole said.But he recently had his tonsils and adenoids removed, allowing him to breathe on his own and freeing him from the array of medical equipment that was hooked up to him. Since then, the parents have seen a vast improvement. He's begun lifting his head and using his hands and feet in ways he couldn't before -- a spark of hope after a year of heartache.   On the fridge, the family displays a hand-splattered painting by Anias, titled by his parents.  Painted this with the right hand that I'm not supposed to be able to use, it says. Anias had like Mount Everest medically, Nicole said. That's what I've started to appreciate is, he climbed his medical mountain.Christian said, He's making progress. It's just slow. But it's there, every day.When CNN last visited, the boys were closer in their progress, considering that the surgery had set them back to infancy in many ways. They had to learn how to sit up, crawl and do the other things every baby learns. Anias was a few months behind Jadon developmentally, but it seemed he was on track to catch up. He was able to roll and clap his hands.What was hard was to see that he was on the same path as Jadon, and then something happened -- lots of things happened -- to pull him out of that race for a minute, Nicole said. I feel like I'm constantly fighting for the Anias I know. As a mom, she says, you just want him to fly, and he's still stuck on the ground.  That was really difficult, but we just had this ray of hope, like in the last month.That's lifts us both, she said, and we're ready to help him take off.He's the most medically stable he's ever been. He's getting stronger every day, she said. I think we're going to see a huge change in him over this next year.She's determined to see Anias become the boy she believes he can be. She tells him things like someday, you're going to sit up. Someday, you're going to walk to me. He often smiles at her encouraging words. Both parents say they are focused in the moment, simply trying to enjoy their boys and relishing their growth. The boys, they may not be perfectly normal little boys like you and me, Christian said. But that doesn't mean they can't have a great life.He says he and his wife used to worry about things like whether the boys' hair would grow back enough to cover the scars on their heads from the various surgeries. But now, they now intentionally cut their hair short: They earned those scars. You know, they can be proud of them. At the family table, Nicole recounts a story of Jadon spilling a drink at lunch and how he put her at ease, saying, Mommy, it's just an accident. She says he then looked at her and said, I am smart. She laughed and told him, You are smart. Nicole was still laughing when Jadon added, I am funny.As she tells this story, Jadon looks at her attentively. She bends down and kisses him on the top of his head. He decides to tack on third adjective to describe himself. And happy, he squeals. Jadon is happy, Nicole tells him.Nadia Kounang contributed to this story. "},

But it soon prompted  from around the globe.Chinese scientist He Jiankui announced in November that he had created the first gene-edited babies, twin girls whose DNA had been edited using the CRISPR-Cas9 tool to protect them from HIV.Editing the DNA of human embryos had never been done before, for good reason, and the scientist went against the advice of experts in the field to conduct the work, which could lead to a multitude of unknown genetic complications for the children.Everyone he talked to -- which was not many people -- had said don't go there, don't do it, explained Robin Lovell-Badge of the UK research facility the Francis Crick Institute, who organized the scientific summit in Hong Kong during which the news broke in November. He had already been told not to proceed, he said.The announcement came on the eve of this summit, the Second International Summit on Human Genome Editing. Two days later, He defended his work on the scientific stage and announced that a second pregnancy using the technology was underway.Then He went into hiding, having received threats, explained Lovell-Badge, who provided new detail of the events Monday. His last contact with the Chinese scientist was on December 1.Before the meeting, it was clear that we was up to something, Lovell-Badge said, explaining that there had been rumors that He was seeking local ethical approval to edit the embryos. This was why He was invited to attend and speak at the conference: to get him around peers and calm his ambition. None of us knew how far he'd actually got, Lovell-Badge said, adding that experts knew only of his research on mice, monkeysand human embryos. Clearly, we were too late. However, the babies have not been independently confirmed, and the hospital named as approving the research has denied being associated with the scientist.Lovell-Badge believes that He is in an apartment in Shenzhen, surrounded by guards, and said he isunclear whether the guards are there to restrict him or protect him.He made a lot of money selling companies, Lovell-Badge said, which enabled him to fund the research himself, and therefore no funding body validated his work. He was very rich, he said, and treated very well by the Chinese system, which encouraged his return to the country after he trained as a physicist in the United States.Lovell-Badge summarized the scientist as a rich physicist who knew little biology, with a huge ego, someone who wants to be the first to do something he believes will change the world, irrespective of any guidelines. He knew about guidelines not to implant a genetically altered embryo, but he went ahead anyway and was doing it in secret, largely.The scientist consistently believed that he was doing good, Lovell-Badge explained, but the science and his ethics were flawed.For example, He did not know enough about the mutation he was trying to introduce into the babies -- known as Delta 32 -- which was intended to protect the girls from HIV but could also increase the risk of West Nile virus and influenza, previous research had shown. He had told Lovell-Badge on stage at the conference that he was aware of the rise in risk of those two diseases but believed that the risk of West Nile virus not an issue in China and claiming that the influenza research had been flawed. However, a few days later, He asked Lovell-Badge for more information on the influenza link.Lovell-Badge believes the babies' families were not informed of the influenza link when giving their consent to He, despite the virus being a huge risk in China. It's quite possible he has put the children at risk, he said, adding to the unethical point that the scientist obtained consent himself, rather than through an impartial third party.In addition, there are effective ways to prevent HIV from being passed from parents to children, meaning the controversial research did not even have an unmet clinical need, Lovell-Badge said. But the stigma around HIV in China seemed to be what drove the Chinese scientist, he said.A big question looming over the series of events is whether these gene-edited babies truly exist, with no proof of their existence and no peer-reviewed research on He's work. It's simply his word.His work on mice and monkeys had been presented at conferences, however, Lovell-Badge explained, and He had told the Summit about submitting a paper on the gene-edited babies for review to a reputable scientific journal. Where that paper is now remains a mystery, however.The flaws in his approach also make Lovell-Badge believe that the babies are real. If he was going to make this up, he would have made it up much better than this, he said. I'm pretty sure he's done it. The only real way to know is to test the DNA of the babies, which he believes Chinese authorities will ensure as part of their investigations.In addition, He had a US PR person at his side, Ryan Ferrell, who advised him to create videos explaining his news to post on YouTube as well as to provide access to the Associated Press to follow his work, all for a big unveiling, probably in 2019.But the order of play was interrupted by the , which caught wind of the work and reported on it, making the news global as the Hong Kong summit was due to begin, Lovell-Badge said. Chaos ensued. He hadn't planned to hijack the meeting. Lovell-Badge believes that He will be punished and locked up or fined as Chinese authorities conclude their investigation and that many people involved will lose their jobs. He also fears for the future of the babies, who may have their fate, and future reproduction, controlled.As for the field as a whole, Lovell-Badge said, discussions began in 2015 on the need for a pathway for scientists to follow in order to show certain stages of research before finally editing embryos, with more need for this now than ever.Clear laws need to be in place, he said, as many countries -- except the UK and the United States -- have guidelines but not clear outlines for laws and resulting punishments if such research is conducted, paving the way for a maverick scientist like He.The Chinese hospital named in He's ethical approval documents, Shenzhen Harmonicare Women's and Children's Hospital, denies involvement in the procedures. We can ensure that the research wasn't conducted in our hospital nor were the babies born here, a hospital representative   Initial investigations by the hospital said that signatures on He's ethics review form are suspected to be forged.But properly done, there is a place for genome germline editing, Lovell-Badge believes, with the germline being the genes and cells passed down through generations. Editing could target diseases with a true clinical need, he said, such as cystic fibrosis or the blood disorder beta-thalassemia.What there is no place for: scientists simply on a mission to be the first to do something. He should certainly be stopped from doing anything like this again. CNN's Helen Regan contributed to this report."},
{"title": "Change your diet to combat climate change in 2019", "cate": "health", "content": "You may be aware that a plant-based diet can make you healthier by lowering your risk for obesity, heart disease and Type 2 diabetes. But research shows there's another good reason to regularly eat meatless meals. By filling your plate with plant foods instead of animal foods, you can help save the planet.One study, in the journal Nature, found that as a result of population growth and the continued consumption of Western diets high in red meats and processed foods, the environmental pressures of the food system could increase by up to 90% by 2050, exceeding key planetary boundaries that define a safe operating space for humanity beyond which Earth's vital ecosystems could become unstable, according to study author Marco Springmann of the Oxford Martin Programme on the Future of Food at the University of Oxford.It could lead to dangerous levels of climate change with higher occurrences of extreme weather events, affect the regulatory function of forest ecosystems and biodiversity ... and pollute water bodies such that it would lead to more oxygen-depleted dead zones in oceans, Springmann said.If the whole world, which continues to grow, eats more like us, the impacts are staggering, and the planet simply can't withstand it, said Sharon Palmer, a registered dietitian nutritionist and plant-based food and sustainability expert in Los Angeles who was not involved in the new research. Sustaining a healthier planet will require halving the amount of food loss and waste, and improving farming practices and technologies. But it will also require a shift toward more plant-based diets, according to Springmann. As Palmer noted, research consistently shows that drastically reducing animal food intake and mostly eating plant foods is one of the most powerful things you can do to reduce your impact on the planet over your lifetime, in terms of energy required, land used, greenhouse gas emissions, water used and pollutants produced.It might come as a surprise, but Springmann's study found that the production of animal products generates the majority of food-related greenhouse-gas emissions -- specifically, up to 78% of total agricultural emissions. This, he explained, is due to manure-related emissions, to their low feed-conversion efficiencies (meaning cows and other animals are not efficient in converting what they eat into body weight) and to enteric fermentation in ruminants, a process that takes place in a cow's stomach when it digests food that leads to methane emissions. The feed-related impacts of animal products also contribute to freshwater use and pressures on cropland, as well as nitrogen and phosphorus application, which over time could lead to dead zones in oceans, low-oxygen areas where few organisms can survive, according to Springmann.For an example of how animal foods compare with plant-based foods in terms of environmental effects, consider that beef is more than 100 times as emissions-intensive as legumes, Springmann said. This is because a cow needs, on average, 10 kilograms of feed, often from grains, to grow 1 kilogram of body weight, and that feed will have required water, land and fertilizer inputs to grow. In addition, cows emit the potent greenhouse gas methane during digestion, which makes cows and other ruminants such as sheep especially high-emitting. Other animal foods have lower impacts because they don't produce methane in their stomachs and require less feed than cows, Springmann explained. For example, cows emit about 10 times more greenhouse gases per kilogram of meat than pigs and chickens, which themselves emit about 10 times more than legumes.Like animals, plants also require inputs from the environment in order to grow, but the magnitude is significantly less, Springmann explained.In today's agricultural system, we grow plants to feed animals, which require all of those resources and inputs: land, water, fossil fuels, pesticides, herbicides and fertilizer to grow. And then we feed plants to animals and care for them over their lifetime, while they produce methane and manure, Palmer said.Adopting more plant-based diets for ourselves could reduce the greenhouse gas emissions of the food system by more than half, according to the Nature study. A mainly plant-based diet could also reduce other environmental impacts, such as those from fertilizers, and save up to quarter use of both farmland and fresh water, according to Springmann.Palmer explained that legumes [or pulses], such as beans, lentils and peas are the most sustainable protein source on the planet. They require very small amounts of water to grow, they can grow in harsh, dry climates, they grow in poor nations, providing food security, and they act like a natural fertilizer, capturing nitrogen from the air and fixing it in the soil. Thus, there is less need for synthetic fertilizers. These are the types of protein sources we need to rely upon more often.Experts agree that if you are not ready to give up meat entirely, a flexitarian diet, which is predominantly plant-based, can help. This diet includes plenty of fruits, vegetables and plant-based protein sources including legumes, soybeans and nuts, along with modest amounts of poultry, fish, milk and eggs, and small amounts of red meat. Vegetarian and vegan diets would result in even lower greenhouse gas emissions, but a flexitarian diet is the least stringent that is both healthy and would reduce greenhouse gas emissions enough for us to stay within environmental limits, according to Springmann.Palmer said that although vegan diets, followed by vegetarian diets, are linked with the lowest environmental impacts, not everyone is interested in taking on those lifestyles. But everyone can eat more of a flexitarian diet. It doesn't mean that you have to give up meat completely, but you significantly reduce your intake of it. Registered dietitian nutritionist Dawn Jackson Blatner described it this way: A flexitarian is really someone who wakes up with the intention of being more vegetarian. It's different from vegetarian in that there is some flexibility.Just how flexitarian you wish to be can be flexible, too. For example, Blatner, who was not involved in the Nature study, offers three levels of the diet in her book The Flexitarian Diet: a beginner flexitarian, who consumes six to eight meatless meals per week (or is limited to 26 ounces of animal protein); an advanced flexitarian, who eats nine to 14 meatless meals per week (or is limited to 18 ounces of animal protein); and an expert flexitarian, who eats at least 15 meatless meals or limits animal protein to 9 ounces per week.The key is not just eliminating meat but swapping in plant-based proteins, including beans and lentils. A Mediterranean meal might incorporate chickpeas; a Mexican meal might have black beans or pintos; an Asian meal might include edamame; an Italian meal might use white beans or lentils to make a Bolognese pasta sauce, Blatner explained.I wrote the book because I really wanted to be a vegetarian, but I just couldn't do it so strictly, she said. I really wanted to lean in to a more plant-based diet, but I needed a little more flexibility. So it's the great compromise. To get started on a flexitarian diet, here's a sample three-day plan, courtesy of Blatner. You'll notice that some meals have a choice of a plant-based protein or an animal-based protein. Choose plant as often as you can, and you'll soon be an expert-level flexitarian of 15-plus meatless meals per week.Breakfast of avocado toast: sprouted whole-grain toast + avocado + spinach + eggLunch of kale ranch bowl: chicken or chickpeas + chopped kale/tomatoes + roasted sweet potato cubes + ranch dressingDinner of tacos: seasoned white fish or lentils + corn tortillas + cabbage slaw + guacamole + salsaSnack of apple + pecans and/or cucumber + hummusBreakfast of peanut butter oatmeal: oatmeal + natural peanut butter + chopped appleLunch of a Mexican bowl: chicken or black beans + chopped romaine/peppers + brown rice + guacamole + salsaDinner of a Mediterranean plate: chicken or chickpeas + cucumber/tomato/feta salad + lemon-dill brown riceSnack of grape tomatoes + mozzarella stick and/or clementine + pistachiosBreakfast of green belly smoothie: 2% plain kefir + rolled oats + banana + spinachLunch of Asian bowl: chicken or edamame + coleslaw mix + quinoa + ginger dressingDinner of burgers: beef or bean burger + sweet potato fries + veggie dippers with ranchSnack of carrots + almond butter and/or dark chocolate + berriesLisa Drayer is a nutritionist, an author and a CNN health and nutrition contributor.

{"title": "Unethical experiments' painful contributions to today's medicine ", "cate": "health", "content": "Chinese scientist  sent shockwaves around the world last year with his claim that he had modified twin babies' DNA before their birth. The modification was made with gene editing tool CRISPR-Cas9, he said, and made the babies resistant to HIV. Scientists from China and around the world spoke out about the experiment, which many say was unethical and not needed to prevent the virus. The scientist had also beennot to go down this path.His experiments, which are still clouded with the uncertainty of his claims and his whereabouts, open a Pandora's box of questions around ethics in experiments with humans -- even though these dilemmas aren't new.Historic examples of human experimentation include wartime atrocities by Nazi doctors that tested the limits of human survival. Another led to the creation of the hepatitis B vaccine prototype. Wendell Johnson, who made several contributions to the field of communication disorders, tried to induce stuttering in normally fluent children. In the , prisoners in Illinois were infected with malaria to test anti-malaria drugs. Such experiments have been criticized as unethical but have advanced medicine and its ethical codes, such as the Nuremberg Code. When He made his claim of genetically altering humans, the response from the global medical community was swift and condemning. It is out of the question that the experiment is unethical, said Jing Bao Nie, professor of bioethics at the University of Otago in New Zealand. Without medical necessity, it is not ethical to carry out gene editing.Sarah Chan, director of the University of Edinburgh's Mason Institute for Medicine, Life Sciences and the Law, adds that the balance of risks and benefits make it hard to justify this experiment. Genome editing of embryos is still not fully established, and virtually all scientists will say we don't yet know enough about It to be able to recommend that we just go ahead with it clinically, she said.If it were the case of a life-threatening disease that will cause tremendous pain, and the only way to alleviate the pain would be a risky experimental procedure, then Chan thinks given the immense benefit, we could produce perhaps taking that risk is justified. When it comes to medical ethics, different principles need to be weighed against each other by an institutional review board, deciding over experiments involving human participants. Medical ethicists and researchersthat there are seven general rules for an ethical experiment involving humans, explained Govind Persad, assistant law professor at the University of Denver. Experiments should be socially valuable and scientifically valid, and people have to be selected fairly and respected. The risks and benefits to participants and the benefits to society need to be weighed against each other, and there needs to be an independent outside review of the ethics of the experiment, Persad said. The risks and benefits equation sometimes includes third-party consideration, such as tests of a vaccine that includes a virus that can shed and infect others who are not research participants, Persad said. Research on smallpox vaccine is one . If He's experiment produced any mutations, these could be passed down to the twins' children and then diffuse into the general population, which didn't consent to that change, Persad explained. I don't know how large of a risk that is, Persad said. Because again, it depends on the odds of the mutation, whether the mutation was one that would end up staying in the population or whether it would be selected out over time.Many of national and international protocols, like the 2005 , include some of these seven principles, Persad said. But as with most international documents, these protocols are not legally binding.   The first document outlining how research should be done in a fair way was a product of Nazi war atrocities. During the 1940s, Nazi doctors conducted human experiments on prisoners in concentration camps. In all of these experiments, which  by the Jewish Virtual Library describes as acts of torture, prisoners were forced into danger, nearly all enduring mutilation and pain, and many experiments had fatal outcomes. Most famously, experiments were conducted by , who was interested in twins and performed agonizing and often lethal research on them. Renate Guttmann was one of the Mengele Twins, according to the Holocaust Encyclopedia, subjected to experiments such as injections that made her vomit and have diarrhea, and blood being taken from her neck.Twenty Nazi doctors were sentenced in the 1945-46 Nuremberg trials. The process resulted in the first ethics document, , a 10-point declaration on how to conduct ethical scientific research.But some doctors felt that this code did not apply to them. A decade later, pediatrician Dr. Saul Krugman was asked to do something about rampant hepatitis in the Willowbrook State School for children with intellectual disabilities on Staten Island, New York. Krugman found that over  at the school were infected. Contracting hepatitis was inevitable and predictable due to poor hygiene at the overcrowded school, according to the  Krugman and his colleagues carried out in Willowbrook. He decided to try to develop a vaccine, and parents were informed and asked for consent.Krugman's experiment helped him discover two strains of hepatitis -- A and B -- and how these spread, A spreading via the fecal-oral route and B through intimate contact and transfer of body fluids. Fifteen years later, he developed a prototype hepatitis B vaccine.In his paper, Krugman agrees with criticism that the ends do not justify the means but says he does not believe that to apply to his own work, since all children at the school were constantly exposed to the risk of acquiring hepatitis.The subsequent  pointed out that the central ethical question around Krugman's work is whether it can be acceptable to perform a dangerous experiment on a person, in this case the Willowbrook students, who will themselves see no benefit from it. Kelly Edwards, professor of bioethics at the University of Washington, thinks back to the needed balance of risks and benefits in an experiment. We had a trend of saying 'this group of people is already suffering,'  she says, which inspired researchers to study these populations for some generalizable knowledge that would help others. But we still are really taking advantage of this one group of people suffering. She believes there are now other methods that would have brought the same results. But because the vaccine was acquired in this unethical way and we are using the tainted data -- results from unethical experiments -- Edwards says we owe some recognition to the children who contributed to that knowledge.The need for retribution and compensation is found in a famously unethical experiment: the Tuskegee syphilis study. Syphilis was seen as a major health problem in the 1920s, so in 1932, the US Public Health Service and the Tuskegee Institute in Alabama began a study to record the natural progression of the disease. The study observed 600 black men, 201 of whom did not have the disease. In order to incentivize participants, they were offered free medical exams, meals and burial insurance. But they were not informed of what was being investigated; instead, they were told that they would receive treatment for bad blood -- a local term that the  says was used to describe several illnesses, including syphilis, anemia and fatigue.Those who carried the diseases were not treated for syphilis, even when penicillin became an effective cure in 1947. After the first reports about the study in 1972, an advisory panel was appointed to review the Tuskegee study. Their conclusion was that the knowledge gained was sparse compared to the risks to the subjects. The study concluded in October of that year.Shortly after, a class-action lawsuit was filed on behalf of the participants and their families. A $10 million settlement was reached.The Tuskegee Health Benefit Program was established to pay compensation such as lifetime medical benefits and burial services to all living participants and their wives and children. President Bill Clinton publicly apologized for the study .Edwards noted that many medicines and vaccines now in routine use were obtained initially through unethical means, and some of them are not even as much on our consciousness. Thewas tested in 1955 on women in Puerto Rico who were not told that they were involved in a clinical trial or that the pill was experimental and had potentially dangerous side effects. The 1979  into ethical guidelines for scientific research made informed consent US law and therefore such experiments illegal. The commission responsible for the Belmont report also wrote topic-specific reports, one of which was on the use of prisoners in experiments. It was a pretty widespread practice to use prisoner populations, Edwards said, because it was seen as offering them a way to repay their debts to society.One place where prisoners were used in experiments was Holmesburg Prison in Philadelphia in the 1950s. Dermatologist Dr. Albert M. Kligman, famous for patenting the acne treatment Retin-A, conducted many tests on these inmates. Retin-A was partially based on Kligman's experiments on prisoners at Holmesburg, according to . Some included studying the reaction to dangerous chemicals, such as , an Agent Orange ingredient, the removal of  to see how fingers react to abuse, or the infestation of inmates with . One psychiatrist working at Holmesburg at the same time as Kligman reported that tranquilizers, antibiotics and Johnson & Johnson toothpaste and mouthwash were all tested on inmates, according to Sana Loue in : Theory and Practice.Participating in these experiments was one of way for prisoners to earn money and a further means to control them, Loue said. Prisoners' inability to give consent because their lives are completely controlled by others and the large risk of coerciveness are what inspired the Belmont report to rule out experiments with this vulnerable population, Edwards said. The reports that followed these experiments were used to draw up laws and governance bodies, such as institutional review boards. These boards are made up of a small group of representatives from the institution that would like to carry out the experiment and one non-scientific community representative; they decide whether an experiment is ethical and should go ahead. Edwards says the institutional review boards offer a small one-time assessment of the situation. She hopes for more ongoing ethical review practices during experiments, like data safety monitoring, used mainly in clinical trials. This monitoring tool can halt an experiment at any time. Chan also sees the need for more discussions around ethics. He's experiment and the second international human genome editing summit in Hong Kong, where He publicly defended , showed that there is a real will to have these discussions seriously [and] to consider both what the benefits are but also to consider very carefully the conditions under which we should be using these technologies, she said."},
{"title": "Dynamic duos: Why science loves twins", "cate": "health", "content": "One of the broadest studies of twins in the United States suggests that our genes tend to influence the diseases that afflict us more than where we live, according to research published Monday in the journal Using insurance claims , researchers identified more than 56,000 pairs of twins and estimated the heritability of 560 diseases, finding that nearly a third of the variation in these conditions could be attributed to genetics, on average. Where people grew up was less contributory on the whole.But that still means the majority of the variation we see in human disease is unaccounted for by genetic or ZIP codes.The relationship between genetics and environment in disease is incredibly nuanced, said study author Chirag Patel, assistant professor of biomedical informatics at Harvard Medical School.Of the diseases the researchers looked at, 40% had a significant genetic component, and about 25% had an environmental one -- though the strength of that relationship could be different for any given disease. For example, morbid obesity was found to be strongly influenced by genetics and the environment, Patel said.You get people who are very deterministic, who say 'it's genes' or 'it's environment.' This shows it's a mixture, said Jeffrey M. Craig, associate professor at the Deakin University School of Medicine and deputy director of Twins Research Australia. Craig was not involved in the new study.As twin registries merge and incorporate big data, as in the new study, experts like Craig look forward to new stages of twins enriching science.That's one of the ways twin research is growing, he said. Scientists love to study twins because they help answer age-old questions about nature vs. nurture. Identical twins share the same genes, so any differences between them -- say, more wrinkled versus less wrinkled skin -- could be the result of their environment.Studies of human health are plagued by these confounding factors, Craig said, including when someone was born, where they were born and their socioeconomic status, ethnicity and gender. Often, twins are perfect controls, he said.About 33 in every 1,000 human births in the United States are twins, a rate that has climbed in recent decades as more women marry later and take fertility drugs or employ in vitro fertilization, factors that are known to increase the likelihood of multiple births. Identical twins are an even more exclusive club: roughly four in every 1,000 births. They are formed when a single fertilized egg splits in two, creating two embryos with the same DNA.Attempts to put twins under the proverbial microscope go as far back as 1875, when English scientist Francis Galton, who was also Charles Darwin's half-cousin, first came upon the twin research design, which is really a very simple and very elegant way of looking at behavior, said Nancy Segal, professor of psychology and director of the Twin Studies Center at California State University, Fullerton. Segal is a fraternal twin herself.According to a paper in the , Galton published the first detailed attempt to use the phenomenon of twinning to estimate the relative powers of nature and nurture. But he took the research to a troubling conclusion and argued repeatedly for the need for the state or its wiser citizens to seek to encourage the best to outbreed the rest, ultimately coining the term eugenics.In more recent years, however, twins have revealed a genetic component to a number of outcomes such as epilepsy, religiosity, autism and mental health, according to experts. NASA even conducted its own  on how astronaut Scott Kelly's gene expression changed after a year on the International Space Station, relative to that of his identical twin, Mark, who remained on Earth.Twins have also suggested that something outside the genetic code can explain why one identical twin might develop  or Parkinson's disease and the other doesn't.Four decades ago, when I was coming up, there was very little acknowledgment of genetic influences on children's mental health, said Judy Silberg, scientific director of the largest twin registry in the United States, the Mid-Atlantic Twin Registry. Everything was pretty much due to poor parenting, specifically mothers.But now, researchers understand that there are varying levels of heritability to things like attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, schizophrenia,  and depression -- and life events may cause those genes to come online, said Silberg, who is also an associate professor of human and molecular genetics and psychiatry at Virginia Commonwealth University.The pendulum has swung really significantly since then, she said.One festival for twins has also become one big Petri dish for scientists: , an annual event that brings thousands of twins to northeastern Ohio.Year after year, a cluster of research tents invites twins to contribute to a potpourri of science. In past years, Procter & Gamble, the maker of Olay, has studied twins to better understand the aging process and its effect on skin. The Los Angeles Police Department has looked at slight differences between twins' fingerprints to improve its identification tools. Biometric researchers have photographed and recorded twins speaking in order to create better facial and voice recognition systems. The FBI has funded similar research there, as well.We collect a year's worth of data in four hours, Danielle Reed, a behavioral geneticist at the Monell Chemical Senses Center, Our question is whether some people are taste-blind and, if so, to what? Our interest is whether this is a genetically determined trait, she said. We like to compare genetically identical twins to twins that are no more similar than ordinary siblings.This can help food scientists understand which traits -- say, an affinity for bitter flavors -- are most strongly determined by genetics.You can imagine, if we look subjectively at their DNA, we could predict what will taste better or worse to people, Reed said. So you can tailor dietary advice to people's actual ability to taste and smell.Traditionally, researchers have studied identical twins versus fraternal controls. These sibling pairs share the same upbringing and environment, but identical twins share all their DNA and fraternal twins onlyabout half.There's also value in looking at children of twins and at twins raised apart, Silberg said, which could shed light on whether certain behaviors or disorders are likely to be passed down through parents' genes versus their home environments. There's even research by twins, for twins -- looking at their special bond in order to best counsel them in therapy, Craig said.But even though twin research long predates the discovery of the double helix, advancements in genetics have not replaced twins, who continue to unravel our most elusive traits.My message is that all research in all fields should include twins, Craig said.CNN's Brandon Griggs contributed to this report."},
{"title": "'A legal form of abuse': Conversion therapy is lurking in the shadows", "cate": "health", "content": "For months, someone was trying to change Andy Taylor's sexuality. He just didn't know it.I had no idea what was going on, Taylor recalled, thinking back to a series of unnerving one-on-one meetings with a church leader in Liverpool, England, in 2012. Even after I quit, I didn't fully realize that what I went to was conversion therapy.But he was sure of one thing: I just knew I didn't like it.Taylor, an openly gay man in his early 20s, had been involved with a local church whose leaders had encouraged him to take therapy sessions. Unbeknownst to him until he stepped inside, the sessions were intended to make him believe that he was straight.These so-called conversion therapies, also known as reparative treatments, rely on the assumption that sexual orientation can be changed or cured -- an idea debunked and discredited by  in the UK, the United States and elsewhere. During his meetings, Taylor says, he was asked to recount childhood traumas and to discuss in detail his sexual experiences with men. They knew what outcome they wanted... They looked for big emotional buttons to press, and they would just pick at them until I started crying, he said. Those events and insecurities were then connected to his sexual attractions.When was the first time you saw your mother cry? Taylor recalls being asked before having his answers maneuvered toward a pseudo-psychological conclusion. You have an overabundance of compassion, and you interpret that to mean you're sexually attracted to men, he was told.It makes absolutely no sense, but at the time, it seemed totally logical, Taylor said, and it led him to the seemingly natural conclusion that his sexuality was bad -- and that he had ought to resist it.It came from someone I trusted, he said. I had no reason not to believe him.That trust persevered even as Taylor's mental state didn't. He began having thoughts about self-harm and vivid dreams about suicide, falling into a period of depression. I went to three or four sessions before it started to disturb me.Eventually, he started to question the logic behind the sessions. I'm pushing myself towards this goal which makes me incredibly uncomfortable, and the journey makes me feel horrific, he remembered thinking.It just felt so wrong. It felt like someone twisting a knife in me.About six months after his first meeting, while signing into another, he realized that he couldn't continue.Looking back, it's one of the most manipulative things anyone's ever done to me, he remembered.Taylor's experience is jarring, but it isn't uncommon.Studies have found that efforts to change a young person's sexuality can put them at a . Despite being condemned by medical bodies and having its science debunked by experts worldwide, the practice is legal throughout most of Europe, where campaigns and petitions to halt it exist in several countries.One in 20 LGBT people in the UK has been offered conversion therapy, and an additional 2% have taken part in it, of over 100,000 people by the UK government in 2017. Tens of thousands of people said they had been offered some form of [conversion] therapy, a government spokeswoman said in a statement to CNN. It is shocking to hear people are being exploited in this way after opening up about their sexuality or gender identity.But she added that the therapy represents a complex set of issues with lots of grey areas - namely, thatunlike the military-style camps in the United States, the practice often occurs in the shadows across the Atlantic.Led by the ex-gay movement in churches, the controversial service is offered discreetly by religious leaders and psychotherapists and sometimes not even explained to its subjects, as was the case with Taylor.These things aren't advertised in the phone book, he said.Matt Ogston, 40, created a foundation campaigning for a ban on conversion therapy in 2014. That year, his partner, Naz Mahmood, had been urged to find a cure for his sexuality by his Muslim parents, who discovered the treatments online and through word of mouth.Mahmood, 34, killed himself days later.It's very clear to see the impact that parents can have on their own children when they think they have a disease, Ogston said. We hear countless stories from individuals who come forward asking for support, where their families threatened to kill them, in some instances.Ogston had protested, sent petitions to government, and met with cabinet ministers to make his case, to little avail.Then, last July and seemingly out of the blue, the UK government made the announcement he had been waiting for years to hear: it planned to ban conversion therapy in the country.The relief of the news, however, soon turned to frustration.It was a very welcome step, but it feels like an empty promise at the moment, Ogston said, complaining that his organization has worked to discuss the details of the pledge with the Government Equalities Office (GEO), but hasn't heard back. You'd expect them to be reaching out, he adds.A GEO spokeswoman told CNN that the government is now assembling its LGBT advisory panel of experts, whose first task will be establishing the path forward onbanningconversion therapy, It has also begun commissioning new research into the experiences of those who have undergone conversion therapy to help us better understand how we can end these practices for good, she added.Ogston is urging that the issue is kept atop the political agenda.Every day in the news we can see why this is not their priority -- you can see where all their energy is, he says, referring to the attention-sapping saga of Brexit. But it should be given priority... the government should be there to protect its citizens.It's not a fringe issue -- it's an issue that isn't being talked about enough, he concludes. It's a legal form of abuse -- and it has to be stopped.If the UK bans the practice, it could prompt a wave of similar legislation across Europe. But it won't quite make Britain the continent's pacesetter.That mantle belongs to Malta -- a tiny island nation in the Mediterranean with a population of just over 400,000 -- which made history by implementing a nationwide ban on conversion therapy in 2016.I knew [conversion] therapy existed, but I didn't know it was happening in Malta, said Equalities and European Minister Helena Dalli, who created the law. It was all underground ... until we delved into it and investigated.Dalli was driven to legislate after a man visited her to share his experience of the practice in the predominantly Catholic country. As a teenager, he'd attended a number of traumatic sessions with a therapist, he said -- and was even shown a video of homosexual sex and told to induce vomiting.I was thinking like every mother would think: What if he were my son? Dalli said. I wouldn't want my biggest enemy to go through what he went through.The conversation led her to begin an almost two-year mission to gather evidence, which uncovered several legal practitioners who had previously been hidden.It was a horrible experience, Joseph, an employee in Malta's government who met with Dalli during her search, said of his own encounter. I couldn't eat. I couldn't focus on my studies. ... I was really close to committing suicide.Joseph, who asked to go by only his first name due to his government position, says he went to two sessions with a psychiatrist who invited her pastor husband into the meetings.He kept on insisting that this is something that can be easily changed, something must have been wrong with my upbringing, [that] I was eventually going to die of AIDS, Joseph said. It's the worst kind of abuse.Testimonies like these culminated in Malta's Parliament unanimously approving the ban on conversion therapy in late 2016. For Joseph, the move was an emotional experience, he said. But I can't imagine the number of children who have been exposed to this.And although Dalli was pleased to pioneer the groundbreaking move, her mood is equally reflective.I'm proud and sad at the same time, she said. I'm proud because we passed the legislation, but I'm sad to know that this practice could be happening in other countries and it's not a crime yet.Dalli uses her role as European minister to press the case for banning coversion therapy to leaders of other countries, and the UK's ban will most likely be based on Malta's legislative model, according to Paul Twocock, director of policy at the LGBT rights charity Stonewall, which consulted the British government on the topic.But proposed bans by campaigners and politicians in France, Germany and elsewhere have fallen flat. To those countries, Dalli has a clear message: Get into the shoes of those people who have been through it and how this has affected their lives negatively.No one person deserves not to live a happy and fruitful life, she added. I think that is what we are in politics for: to help people reach their full potential.LGBT campaigners across Europe are hoping their countries take Dalli's advice.It would be helpful, said Hartmut Rus, a campaigner for Germany's largest LGBT rights organization, LSVD.Rus has been studying the German ex-gay movement for over a decade, since he came across literature advertising cures for homosexuality at university in Saxony in 2005. The founder of Zwischenraum, the group that produced the material, has since come out as gay a second time, disavowing the ex-gay movement and campaigning against conversion therapy.And Rus has seen awareness of the issue grow in his country: Only a few people in Germany were aware of the problem in 2005, he says, but a 2018  to have it banned has received over 75,000 signatures.But Parliament is yet to share his concern -- and he fears the consequences if the practice goes deeper underground.The problem is, everything is hidden now. They don't advertise it anymore because they know they will get bad press, he said.Nonetheless, a corner may soon be turned. Before the UK announced its pending ban, the European Parliament to condemn conversion therapy in March, urging EU member states to end the practice.And although no law can bring back his partner, Ogston is convinced that they can prevent future tragedies. While there is a legal 'cure' available, it allows a parent's mind to wander. We have to remove that from a parent's thought process, he said.To him, the argument is simple. This is something that encourages young people to take their lives, he said. How is that allowed to be legal?"},
{"title": "$375,000 price leads disabled mom to ration meds", "cate": "health", "content": "Bhanu Patel couldn't believe the news. The cost of the medication that allows her to move -- the one that enabled her to walk stairs again -- shot up to $375,000. Fear gripped her: What would this mean for her independence? Would she become a financial burden on her family? How is this possible in the country that's given her so much?The past three years, she said, the medication had been completely free as part of a specialty program. Until recently, the drug was known as 3,4-DAP made by Jacobus Pharmaceutical. But late last year, Catalyst Pharmaceuticals wonFDA approval for a slightly modified version of the drug  and announced an annual list price of $375,000 for the new drug, called Firdapse. For Patel, the drug has been a game-changer. She was diagnosed in 2015 with a rare neuromuscular disease called , a condition known as LEMS that affects about 400 people in the United States, according to The disease attacked her hip muscles and abdominal muscles first, then her back muscles she said. Just trying to stand up to walk was agonizing. She dragged herself across rooms and up and down stairs to get around her home. For two years, she wore three back braces on top of each other to allow her to stand. The disease even attacked her tongue, making it difficult to eat. She lost a lot of weight, and her muscles atrophied. Every aspect of her life was impacted.When she was introduced to the drug, her doctor told her it would make her feel more alert and allow her to regain basic functions. Her eyes opened wide when she first took the pills. I said, 'Wow, you're right about that,'  Patel, 67, recalled. You feel you want to live and have a life.Without this medication, you just can't even move. It's like your body is totally like a sweet potato.So imagine the predicament a skyrocketing price hike puts a patient like her, she said. Fearful of burdening her family with exorbitant bills, Patel said, she's begun rationing her meds -- taking two pills a day, instead of four. She said she's trying to stretch her three-month supply for as long as possible.The words that I can use is I can't believe this is happening, to be honest, she said.Her son, Krishan Patel, said his mother has been rejected by Medicare forcoverage of the medication, raising concerns the family could get stuck with a massive bill. He said she is appealing for coverage as an exception. His mother has also applied with the Assistance Fund, a nonprofit organization that helps pay for patients' co-pays. He said she has yet to hear back.Between his sister and him, Krishan Patel said, they will do everything they can to help their mother. He's already begun writing and calling lawmakers, AARP, the drugmaker and anyone else who will listen.He said he's not just speaking up for his mom, but for those less fortunate. If we're not shining a light on these things, he said, then really what the hell are we doing?My mother's livelihood is fundamentally at the hands of a small outfit with full capability to do whatever they want, he said. You're leveraging human suffering to make money -- and that is a heartbreaking idea.Sen. Bernie Sanders, who earlier this month demanded answers from Catalyst Pharmaceuticals about the drug's $375,000 price, blasted the company for not responding, and he ripped Catalyst for endangering patients' lives. Instead of answering my questions or lowering the price of this drug, they've hired a lobbying firm, Sanders told CNN in a written statement Wednesday. It is now clear that some patients are rationing their supply of Firdapse because they cannot afford to cover the outrageous cost of the drug, which they used to receive at no cost. If Catalyst does not immediately lower the price of the drug, I will ask FDA to allow pharmacies and manufacturers who were previously making this drug to be permitted to resume providing it, so that all patients can get the medication they need.CNN has contacted the US Food and Drug Administration for comment.Two weeks ago, Sanders sent a for its decision to raise the price of Firdapse -- and forcing production and distribution of the older, inexpensive version to cease. Patients had been able to get the previous version of the drug for free through a compassionate use program through the FDA.Catalyst's decision to set the annual list price at $375,000 is not only a blatant fleecing of American taxpayers, but is also an immoral exploitation of patients who need this medication, said Sanders, who on Tuesday announced his latest . I am profoundly concerned that Catalyst's actions will cause patients to suffer or die.Assuming his mother gets approved for the drug, Krishan Patel said Firdapse is listed as a Tier 4 medication on his mother's Medicare with a 40% co-insurance. Even after rebates, he said, the family fears the possibility of spending more than $100,000 a year on the medication.Catalyst maintains patients will be left with little to no cost, despite the fears within the LEMS community. CNN asked Catalyst about the possibility of patients getting stuck with a $100,000 tab as the Patel family has expressed.All Medicare patients are being directed to foundations that support the LEMS community. These foundations are reducing the co-pay for all patients to $0, Catalyst spokesman David Schull said in an email. No out-of-pocket costs for Medicare patients with this set-up. Your facts are wrong.Asked how Catalyst is informing patients about the co-pay program, Schull shot back: Everyone is well informed. We do not have any additional information. I suggest you look for what will be a launch update when the company provides its year-financial resultsand corporate update in March.Krishan Patel said patients like his mother don't have until March to wait when they need answers now. He blasted what he called Catalyst's inconceivable behavior to create anxiety in some of the most vulnerable patients with this disease.That sounds like the most insane statement I've ever heard, he said of Catalyst's response. At the end of the day, it's like: 'Really?'  The Patels aren't the only ones filled with anxiety over this issue. Dr. S. Vincent Rajkumar, a hematologist oncologist with the Mayo Clinic, said he was giving a lecture to Mayo doctors on the rising costs of prescription drugs and what can be done about the issue. Unbeknownst to Rajkumar, one of the doctors brought along a patient who suffers with LEMS. The patient told him she'd been getting the drug from Jacobus for free since 2004 and that she had just been told she would have to pay $3,800 a month in co-pay.That patient was Lore Wilkinson. She was outraged by the price hike she's decided she's not going to take the medicine -- even if it means a rapid decline in her health. She's already begun looking into getting a wheelchair because my quality of life is going to tank.I'm going to do without. I'm not going to be a party of enriching the pockets of this predatory pharmaceutical. Unconscionable! she told CNN. I don't think it's right to be a party to this highway robbery.I would probably choke on it if I took it, she said. That's because I think it's such an outrage.Wilkinson said she was in the process of writing a thank you note to Jacobus for providing the medication for free for so many years. You just wish every pharmaceutical was like theirs, she said.Jeane Arlowe leads a private Facebook group for the LEMS community. She said members of her group have been reeling from the news and trying to wade through the insurance quagmire and Catalyst's enrollment forms. Beyond the price hike, Arlowe said, are other complaints.Most in my support group were on Jacobus DAP, Arlowe said. Many are reporting side effects since being on Firdapse such as racing heart, severe headache, dizziness, exacerbated weakness and gastrointestinal issues. A common complaint is that the Firdapse kicks in too fast and wears off too fast or doesn't work at all.Many of these side effects are identified as possibilities in the drug's  and product information.For Patel, the entire ordeal is overwhelming. She grew up in South Africa during apartheid, often hiding from violence. Her father traveled the world to try to find a better place for his family to live -- Europe, South Asia and South America. Her family eventually settled in Canada, before moving to the United States decades ago. She remembers being taught about America as a girl -- a shining beacon of hope that stood for justice. But her experience with this price hike has soured her.  is the America we live in, she said. An America where one drug can break a person. What does the future hold for my children -- and the children of this country?She sobbed as she described not wanting to be a financial burden on her family.It's just a lot of fear. I have to be honest, she wept. It just doesn't feel good."},
{"title": "'I love sex. I like to make money': What sex workers really want", "cate": "health", "content": "The red curtains are drawn, and the room is dark. It's closed for business.Dark walls, with vibrant patterns in certain places, and a dark ceiling surround a dark bed coated in a protective sheet. A mirror the size of the bed lines the wall adjacent to it.A large bath sits in the middle of the room, with a sink nearby, and a tall red chair sits prominentlyin the corner.The room mirrors many in the De Wallen region in central Amsterdam, home to the city's red light district, with this one regularly rented by a woman who uses the name Foxxy Angel professionally. She rents the room, often referred to as a window, from the Dutch sex workers collective My Red Light.The 37-year-old sex worker can be found here during the day, ready for clients, usually tourists.A pull of the curtain string is all it takes to reveal the heaving crowds on the streets outside and to indicate that the room is open for business.I love sex. I like to make money,said Angel, who has been in the business for more than 15 years. I've had a lot of different jobs before, and this is the only one I really liked.Her window rent costs \u20ac80 a day, she explained, and she typically sees five or six clients per day, making at least \u20ac50 per client. When her shift ends, she also sees clients in bars or clubs and goes on location for larger group experiences.Her hours are her own, and she reports only to herself.After 15 years, I'm still enjoying it every day, she said. But she's set an age limit of 45 before she moves on to focus more on her advocacy work, fighting for sex workers' rights; she's an ardent member of the Dutch Union of Sex Workers, also known as PROUD.She's fighting because Amsterdam, she said, isn't as liberal for sex workers as many believe.Sex work has been legal in some form in the Netherlands since 1830, but it was recognized as a legal profession in 1988. In 2000, a law made the job subject to municipal regulation, requiring a license to operate and following certain rules set by a municipality.Being a sex worker is legal in licensed areas, Angel explained. We have to follow all these rules, and these rules don't guarantee our safety, she said, giving an example of how increased regulation and legalization bring police and municipality checks, which often stop clients from coming in.But she also wants the flexibility bestowed on other professions, she said, such as the option to work from home.Every barber and bookkeeper can work from their homes, but we can't because we're sex workers, she said. We pay the same taxes. We need to have the same rights.A further issue, added Velvet December, advocacy coordinator for PROUD, is that municipalities in the Netherlands have the right to make their own legislation, so each can differ. For example, they can decide how many licenses to give out, she said.Legalization offers some protection, December believes. There are places that it is much more dangerous to do sex work, she acknowledged. We can trust that we are protected by police. We have some rights, but we're not there yet. Angel disagrees, saying she gets limited protection from her profession being legalized.Where sex work is illegal, criminalized or both, workers are forced underground and often subject to harassment by the police,according to Both December and Angel want to get to the point where sex work is decriminalized: Criminal charges for sex work are fully removed, sex work between people is treated like any other work, and it's brought under regular labor laws, according to the Sex Workers Education and Advocacy Taskforce.The only places that have decriminalized sex work are New Zealand and the state of New South Wales in Australia. In both places,sex work is not penalized through punitive laws, and regulation are premised on worker health and safety, as with any other profession. Sex work is truly seen as work and treated as such, December said.The reform in New Zealand is thought to have reduced violence against sex workers, increased their comfort in reporting abuse to the police and improved police attitudes toward sex workers, according to the country's Ministry of Justice.  also showed that decriminalization in New Zealand resulted in sex workers being better able to refuse clients and insist on condom use.  One  showed that decriminalization has the potential to reduce discrimination as well as denials of justice, denigration and verbal abuse. But is the rest of the world ready to catch up?Sex work in settings like Amsterdam are often overly restrictive in ways not supported by evidence, said Sally Shackleton, who works with key populations -- such as sex workers -- at the International HIV/AIDS Alliance. Sex workers around the world are demanding less control and more choices for themselves with the support of the law, she said.CNN spoke with sixsex workers, ranging in age from 36 to 76, across five countries, including Brazil, France, Ukraine and Mexico. They all highlight how they enjoy what they do and say the profession, for them, is a choice. They explained that the sex work industry has changed over time, moving online and often from home, requiring policies that recognize this.Further limiting the model in the Netherlands, Shackleton explained, is the fact that sex workers must work from a defined space, and over time, these spaces have been increasingly small and fewer in number, making competition very high, without the option to work from home.She believes that legalization has helped remove some discrimination and improved some relationships with police, but not to the extent that it has in other places.Decriminalization is consistent with a rights-based approach, said Liesl Gerntholtz, deputy executive program director at Human Rights Watch. Research by  has shown that sex workers face extortion and abuse by police, including forced sex, as well as abuse from health care workers and military forces in settings where the practice is fully criminalized. We see a lot of stigma, she said.A  found that sex workers across 33 countries who face repressive policing -- identified as arrest, imprisonment, confiscation of needles, syringes, condoms, displacement to new area or physical or sexual violence by officers -- have three times higher chance of experiencing physical or sexual violence than the general population.But legalization has also not worked, Gerntholtz said.At the core of legal and policy reform lies a deeply contested issue, she added: the fact that some people believe sex work is offensive to women. This leads to moral objections rather than evidence-based ones that, in turn, mar politics, Shackleton added.I would want to live in a world where women don't have to sell sex, Gerntholtz said, where the work is not a choice. But those who do need to be able to do it safely and with access to health care and protecting their rights.Ultimately, the priority for sex workers, activists, unions and policymakers is enabling safety in an otherwise at-risk profession, experts say. Sex workers are often on the front line of violence, Shackleton said.They are also 14 times more likely to be HIV-positive, are inhibited from reporting crimes against them and subject to exploitation from law enforcement, she added.Taking more of a labor approach to the profession can ensure their rights and fight exploitation, Shackleton believes, but she added that there isn't any one-size-fits-all for legislation.Details need to be customized for a country's context, she said, but highlights that the goal of any law changes or reform should not be to reduce the number of sex workers. That doesn't work.Gerntholtz agrees that a simple law change isn't the solution. If you just change the law tomorrow, it's not going to make a difference, she said, adding that public awareness campaigns, anti-discrimination laws and workshops with police and in schools are needed to change public perceptions and opinions.When Angel first experienced rape in her early days of working, she did not report it to the police. They just say, 'You're a sex worker.' This is the attitude she and sex workers around the world are fighting to change -- along with their rights.Sex work has become about morality and making sure women behave in a way that's expected, Shackleton said. That's the fundamental problem.A previous version of this story misspelled Liesl Gerntholtz's name."},
{"title": "They had abortions late in their pregnancies. These are their stories", "cate": "health", "content": "Strangers have called them monsters, trolled them on social media and said their living children should be taken away. Their darkest moments are judged and politicized by figures who know nothing about them. They feel like involuntary pawns in an ugly, vicious game they didn't ask to play.Women who've had abortions later in their pregnancies are bonded in a sisterhood through a club nobody ever wanted to be a part of, one woman said. She was one of half a dozen women who recently shared their stories with CNN. They chose to speak up after President Donald Trump called on Congress to pass legislation that would ban late-term abortion, .We heard from women whose lives depended on terminating their pregnancies and others who learned that the babies they desperately wanted would not survive -- or would suffer if they did. Some of them have signed onto an open letter now circulating online, titled, to give themselves and others voice.  We also talked to young women who felt desperate, alone, terrified and misled. One had been told she could not get pregnant because of various health conditions, including missed periods. Then, when she did, she unwittingly visited a faith-based pregnancy center, hoping to get an abortion. They told her she wasn't as far along as she was, which made getting an abortion elsewhere more complicated.A normal pregnancy lasts about 40 weeks. About two thirds of abortions happen at or before eight weeks, and almost all -- more than 91% -- occur before 13 weeks, the . Another 8% happen at or before 20 weeks. , abortions after 21 weeks account for slightly more than 1 percent of all abortions that occur in the United States. Abortions later in the second trimester are very rare, and abortions in the third trimester are rarer still.Because many states impose gestational age limits for abortion and deny insurance coverage for the termination of pregnancy, women who get abortions later in their pregnancies have few options. They often need to travel, adding to the cost of what can be a prohibitively expensive procedure. One woman said she feels punished -- yet again -- for the loss of her son each time she makes the monthly loan payment on the thousands of dollars she borrowed to abort him. It was a decision she felt she had no choice but to make; the boy in her belly was missing multiple organs and never would have survived. Some women insist on being named, refusing to hide. Others want to use first names only or pseudonyms, fearing backlash at a time when people seem quicker to hate than listen.But by sharing their stories, these women -- some mentioned above, others highlighted below -- hope they can humanize a subject that's hotly debated and, they say, gravely misunderstood. When people ask how many kids she has, Dana Weinstein tells them she has three living children. That's because the daughter she lost 9\u00bd years ago remains part of her.She was happily married, the mother of a 2-year-old boy and thrilled to be pregnant again. She read stories and wrote a journal to the baby, and she relished when her son rolled his toy cars over her growing belly. Because she was over 35 and in advanced maternal age, she said, her care included additional sonograms later in her pregnancy. When she and her husband went in for one at 29 weeks, they were told that the ventricles, or network of cavities, in their baby's brain were larger than normal, she said. The doctor and technician said they weren't outrageously larger, Weinstein remembered, so she didn't worry. They could deal with whatever this was, she and her husband reasoned. Plus, everything else about their baby was perfect. Still, she was sent to the Children's National in Washington for further testing. Weinstein, who lives in Rockville, Maryland, was at 31 weeks, well into her third trimester, when they got an appointment. Then came the gut punch.There are hard-to-spell words for the brain abnormalities their baby had: agenesis of the corpus callosum and polymicrogyria. In simpler terms, as Weinstein described it, a special MRI showed that the baby didn't have the part of the brain that connects the right and left hemispheres. And where a healthy brain looks like a cauliflower, she said, their baby's brain had concave areas and pockets of empty.What does this mean? What does this mean? she kept asking, before they were whisked off to specialists who could explain.Doctors expected their baby would not be able to suck or swallow, Weinstein recalled. They said she most likely would suffer from uncontrollable seizures upon birth and, because of that, a resuscitation order would be necessary. For as long as she lived, doctors predicted, their baby would require medical intervention.And, as Weinstein understood it, she'd have no mental capacity to dream, love or enjoy life. Her questions came fast. Couldn't rehab help? What if they took stem cells from her son's umbilical cord blood that she'd banked? Maybe they could regrow what her daughter needed? Their baby's brain was destined to be this way from the start, experts said. It could not have been detected earlier and would not improve. They never could have seen it coming. The multiple doctors she surveyed, searching for hope, told her the same. It's just a fluke, Weinstein said. Basically, anyone who could get pregnant could be that fluke. They heard what a resuscitation order would entail. They listened to what an existence, short-lived or otherwise, would look like. They were briefed on hospice care. At first, no one talked about the possibility of abortion this late in her pregnancy. Weinstein believes this was in part because the doctor to whom the hospital had referred rare patients like her in the past, Dr. George Tiller of Wichita, Kansas, had been murdered by an anti-abortion extremist weeks earlier.She could carry the baby for six more weeks and deliver it, she was told. But that extended the nightmare she was living in, she said, one in which they had to choose how their daughter would die. She worried about what their choice would do to their son, their family, their marriage.The endless kicks in Weinstein's belly, the persistent movements that had given her so much joy, became unbearable. She feared that the baby was simply seizing and, worse yet, might be suffering. She fell apart and couldn't sleep. While she had proudly worn cute maternity clothes to show off her bump, she now hid in her husband's clothes. She dreaded the well-meaning question from strangers -- When are you due? -- and refused to leave the house. That agony of every moment till I could end her pain was just awful, Weinstein said. Together with her husband, they decided to get an abortion. For this baby they loved, she said, it felt like the more peaceful path for her passing.She had to fly across the country to Colorado to get the procedure. She felt lucky to have supportive parents who were able to charge the abortion expense, $17,500, on their credit card. She traveled with her husband, her mother and her son so she could have him to hold while at the hotel. The doctor used a sonogram to find the baby's heart. He gave Weinstein an injection through her stomach to stop its beating. She felt her daughter's last movements before she passed away. A few days later, on the very day that marked her 32nd week of pregnancy, she delivered their deceased baby.I'm not going to talk through that part of it, said Weinstein, who stayed calm on the phone but predicted she'd break down right after we hung up. But I would like to say it was not a baby being ripped limb to limb. I delivered an outward-looking beautiful baby.Now 47, she and her husband went on to have two healthy daughters. The first one, now 8, Weinstein refers to as her rainbow baby.We call her that, she said, because after a storm, what's more beautiful than a rainbow?The swelling was the first sign that something was wrong. It showed up in her hands and feet. She struggled to squeeze into shoes. Susan flipped open her What to Expect When You're Expecting book and turned to the section that outlined when to call a doctor. Her kind of swelling and sudden weight gain -- she'd put on 11 pounds in one week -- made the list.She asked her husband of just over a year, a physician, whether he thought she looked OK. He sweetly told her she was beautiful, first thinking she was self-conscious and worried that she was fat. He wasn't an ob-gyn, so she called hers. Have your husband take your blood pressure, just when he's able to, the doctor advised.On their way to dinner in Berkeley, California, that evening, he suggested that they swing by his office first. Her blood pressure was off the charts, Susan remembers 30 years later. Her husband dialed the obstetrician, who asked whether he had any urine testing strips handy. He did, and they showed that Susan's protein levels were dangerously high, indicating a problem with her kidneys.Get over to the hospital right away, the obstetrician ordered.Susan at first balked. She felt fine, just swollen. Plus, she was hungry.Can't we go to dinner first? she asked before being rushed out the door.  She stayed in denial for as long as she could. Doctors were alarmed about her blood pressure, but she wasn't. They said her kidneys were shutting down, but that didn't register. Instead, she focused on the ultrasound they took, which revealed the baby's gender. She looked with excitement at her husband.Oh, my goodness, we're going to have a boy! she said. Aren't you happy? His face was grim, she remembered. He knew that this was not looking good at all.She was at 24 weeks and had severe . Doctors said she was on the verge of having a stroke.It's like you're being poisoned by pregnancy, she said, explaining her condition, And the only way to cure it is to not be pregnant. The fetus was behind in its development and not where it should be at 24 weeks. It needs at least two weeks to be even minimally viable, and you just don't have two weeks, the doctors told her. You don't have two days.Still, she tried to negotiate a deal. She was a physical therapist. She could rehab herself after a stroke, she told them. She could rehab their baby. She wanted to deliver it, if not vaginally, then by C-section. They said her body could not withstand either. They promised her the fetus would feel no pain before stopping its heartbeat. Then they put Susan under to perform the dilation and evacuation procedure, in which the cervix is dilated and the contents of the uterus extracted. Her abortion was a necessity and felt like  such a no-choice choice, said Susan, 59, who later had two daughters. It wasn't what she wanted. It was what she needed to live.She was 19 and living with a host family in Florida when she learned that she was pregnant.Katherine, not her real name, was in the United States on a student visa. She's from Honduras, which has a total ban on abortion, and got pregnant over the summer while visiting home.She was confused, though. The older man she'd dated in Honduras bought a Plan B pill on the black market, she said, and told her to take it. She didn't know what it was or how it worked. When she didn't get her period, she assumed that her hormones were just out of whack because of that strange pill.After a few months back in the United States, though, her body felt and looked different. The home pregnancy test she bought at Walmart was positive, but she clung to the movie plotlines she'd seen where tests came back with false results.When the father in her host family asked whether she was pregnant, she said, No! Why are you asking? She was terrified and didn't know where to turn. She told the man she'd dated in Honduras that she was pregnant, but he wasn't supportive, she said. He said, 'I don't care.' She didn't want to disappoint her family back home. If her host family in Florida learned the truth, she feared, they'd send her back. Katherine had dreams, she said, that depended on staying in college.She could barely concentrate during her final exams -- It was the worst semester of my life, she said -- and then she moved to Texas to transfer to a new school. In the Lone Star State, she felt even more alone. She said she knew no one. By late January 2016, she had clarity: She could not have this baby. She remembered hearing about a man in her Honduras neighborhood who secretly performed abortions, but she couldn't figure out who he was. She learned that abortions were legal in the United States but worried she could never afford one. Then she began searching for options in Texas and found a place near where she lived. Even better, when she called, she was promised a free pregnancy test and ultrasound. The clinic first made her watch a video. It was about God, adoption and parenting, she remembered. It featured women who shared testimonies about the abortions they regretted. Katherine watched but didn't understand their sadness. She'd unknowingly walked into a faith-based clinic that didn't offer abortions. She sat through the video she didn't buy into because, she said, I just wanted help. The ultrasound showed that she was at 30 weeks, further along than she anticipated.There's a place where they can pay you for college, and you can stay there to have the baby, Katherine remembered a woman at the clinic told her. Maybe that was an option, she thought at first, but it wasn't what she wanted. She'd bring a baby into the world only if it had its parents, both of them. She wasn't ready to raise a child. And driving her as much as anything: She refused to be like her own biological mother, who abandoned her in the hospital after she was born.That's not the point of my life, repeating the same story, she said. I didn't want for my baby to feel the same way I feel. ... I'm 23, and I'm still asking these questions about what happened.She insisted that she wanted an abortion.In Texas, it is illegal for you to have an abortion after 20 weeks, the woman at the clinic said. You're going to have to have the baby. The woman asked whether she wanted her ultrasound pictures. Katherine said she didn't. The woman gave them to her anyway. As soon as she got home, she threw them away and sobbed. Then, she turned frantic. She went online to research where she could go and found only two options. She called a clinic in New Mexico, which referred her to a sister clinic in Texas for an exam. That clinic confirmed how far along she was and heard her pleas. They couldn't give her what she wanted, though, but placed a call to New Mexico for her.They're willing to help you, she remembered hearing. But it's going to cost you $12,000.Given how far along she now was, her appointment was quickly put on the schedule. She had just three days to find the money, she said.She worked the phones and fired off emails. With the help of a network of abortion funds that support women who can't afford these procedures, Katherine said, she pulled together $9,000. She begged the clinic in New Mexico to still take her.A third-trimester abortion provider in New Mexico, who didn't want to be named and couldn't speak directly to Katherine's case, offered this to explain why someone like her would be accepted for the procedure.My patients of all gestational ages share this commonality: Whatever their story, they have come to the decision that an abortion is absolutely necessary to preserve their mental or physical health and/or to save their unborn child from a life of suffering, the physician wrote in an email. Katherine was in a nervous haze the day she walked in the clinic doors. She didn't recall the injection that stopped the fetal heartbeat. She also couldn't name the medication she was given, but she definitely remembered the cramping that seized her body later at the hotel. Only after the fact did she realize that she'd gone into labor.I was in pain you can't imagine. I wanted to die, she said. With that pain, I really was regretting having an abortion.But that regret was short-lived. Two days later, when she gave birth to a dead fetus at the clinic, she said, she was overcome with tears of relief.Thank you for changing my future, she remembered saying. Katherine, who to this day has never told a friend or family member about her abortion, knows that some people may read her story and think the worst of her. But it's her body, her life, and she knew what she could -- and couldn't -- handle, she said.She's baffled by the outcry against abortion. She thinks about all the children in the United States and elsewhere who don't have loving homes and aren't given a fair chance. You want the orphanages to have more kids? she asks. You want more kids on the street? She looks forward to being a mother someday, she insists. But she'll do that with a supportive partner when she's older, maybe 30, when she's become the woman she plans to be. "},

He never had the experience of going to the pediatrician, getting pricked in the arm with a needle and then receiving a lollipop or ice cream cone afterward.I had grown up with my mom being very staunch and open about her position against vaccines, Lindenberger  on Monday night. As I became a teenager and looked into it and decided that the evidence supported vaccines by and large, and that the evidence that they cause autism and brain damage and other misinformed statements weren't true, he said.As soon as Lindenberger became a legal adult, he said, he decided to get vaccinated despite his parents' objections. Once I turned 18, I said, 'you know, even though we disagree, still I'm going to pursue vaccinations,'  he said.In a popular  in November, he sought information about how to get his first vaccines.The post begins with my parents think vaccines are some kind of government scheme and goes on to ask where can he go to get certain vaccinations. About a month later, the  to announce that he got his vaccines.I grew up not knowing that you go to the health department and get a shot in your shoulder in your upper arm for a bunch of really big diseases that could have a lot of really bad side effects and a lot of bad implications. So I turned to Reddit and said, 'where do I go to get vaccinated?' ... And so through that, I got some good answers, Lindenberger said.As a child, Lindenberger said, he had the flu but never contracted chickenpox, measles or similar diseases for which he could have been immunized.His journey to get vaccinated, however, stemmed from him wanting to protect others against diseases as much as himself. He and his parents have agreed to disagree on the issue. I was doing it for my safety and the safety of others, he said. My parents are very happy that I'm continuing to express that the importance of a vaccine is beyond just me and other people, and I'm glad to share that story.Lindenberger has younger siblings, and he said that he hopes they get vaccinated.Obviously, it scares me a little bit, but I'm going to try and do my best to convince my parents that they should and hope that works, he said.Lindenberger's decision to get vaccinated comes as the percentage of young children in the United States who have received no vaccines continues to rise.A  in October showed that while coverage for a number of vaccines remained high and stable overall, the segment of unvaccinated kids under 2 rose from 0.9% for those born in 2011 to 1.3% for those born in 2015. In 2001, only 0.3% of kids between 19 and 35 months had received no vaccine doses.Although the number of children who have received no vaccinations by age 24 months has been gradually increasing, most children are still routinely vaccinated, wrote the authors from the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. Continued evaluation of prevalence and reasons for nonvaccination is needed, as are improvements in access to and delivery of age-appropriate vaccinations to all children.In general, each state has its own laws regarding whether a minor may consent to health care, including immunizations, Allison Winnike, president and chief executive officer of the vaccine advocacy group , wrote in an email Tuesday.  Across the U.S., minors generally cannot consent to their own health care; however, there are several federal and state laws that permit a minor to consent to his or her own medical treatment in specific circumstances, but it does not usually include immunizations. Generally, a minor may not consent to immunizations unless they are considered a 'mature minor,' that is, legally emancipated from their parents, Winnike wrote.Generally the parent is the final health care decision maker for the minor, she said. Vaccines save lives and are safe and effective. Vaccines are one of the top 10 public health achievements of the last century for the number of lives they've saved. In fact, vaccines are a victim of their own success; so many diseases have been eliminated or eradicated by vaccines that we no longer see the daily heartache of loved ones dying from what were common illnesses like polio, smallpox, and measles. When we don't see the devastation caused by vaccine-preventable diseases on a daily basis, some people discount the vital need to keep their families safe by vaccinating them.CNN's Michael Nedelman contributed to this report."},
{"title": "Insurer skips doctors and sends massive checks to patients, prompting million-dollar lawsuit", "cate": "health", "content": "A woman received nearly $375,000 from her insurance company over several months for treatment she received at a California rehabilitation facility. A man received more than $130,000 after he sent his fianc\u00e9e's daughter for substance abuse treatment.Those allegations are part of a lawsuit winding its way through federal court that accuses Anthem and its Blue Cross entities of paying patients directly in an effort to put pressure on health care providers to join their network and to accept lower payments. The insurance giant is accused of sending more than $1.3 million in payments to patients -- money, the suit claims, that is owed to the facilities that treated people with addiction and mental health problems. The suit by Sovereign Health highlights part of an ongoing war between insurance companies and providers over payment and billing issues, one that puts the patient right in the middle of the fighting by sending payments straight to patients after they seek out-of-network care. Patients are supposed to send the money on to providers. Many times, they do; other times, they don't.Critics say it's a revenge tactic against doctors, hospitals, treatment facilities and other medical providers that don't agree to insurance companies' demands to be in-network, by making them chase down money. The insurance industry disputes any such characterization. Regardless of who and what is to blame, Arthur Caplan, the director of medical ethics for New York University's School of Medicine, called the idea of insurers sending money to patients insane.My overall, moral reaction is: Are you kidding me? he said of the notion of paying patients.It's almost like winning the lottery, it seems to me. So, I'm not surprised that there are misuses -- and I'm enormously surprised that anyone would think this is a doable approach.Only in our crazy, market-driven, bureaucratic mess of a system, Caplan added, would we think about this kind of a solution. Lisa Kantor, one of the lead attorneys representing five Sovereign Health corporate entities and seven treatment facilities at the heart of the federal case, said she had major concerns over the issue, especially since Sovereign treated such a vulnerable population.One of the things we have to worry about is that kind of money getting into the hands of someone who has an addiction problem, Kantor said.Instead of paying the facilities, she said, Anthem sent checks directly to patients, some while they were still in rehab. It's a strategy that put the providers in the tricky and tenuous position of trying to collect money -- in some cases, very large sums -- from the very people they were trying to help, Kantor said. They were trying to get better, she said, and Anthem was giving them every opportunity not to.When a patient sees an out-of-network provider, she explained, patients sign an assignment of benefits contract that instructs their benefit plan or its administrator to pay the provider for services rendered to the patient. But some insurance plans have anti-assignment clauses that allow for payments to patients, not providers. Anthem, the parent company of Blue Cross health plans, declined comment for this story, citing the pending litigation.  In court filings, Anthem doesn't dispute that checks are made out to patients for various out-of-network care.  But the insurance giant argued that the treatment centers don't have legal standing to make a case in federal court under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, known as ERISA, because patients do not transfer any of their ERISA rights to the provider. For this reason alone, Anthem said in the filings, each claim alleged by Plaintiffs fails as a matter of law and should be dismissed with prejudice.ERISA is that establishes minimum standards for most voluntarily established retirement and health plans, covering an estimated 141 million workers and beneficiaries.Anthem also said in court filings that  determined that anti-assignment provisions are legal and that the insurer is doing nothing wrong: Indeed, courts in many other jurisdictions have held that anti-assignment clauses in ERISA plans are valid and enforceable.Health care providers, medical professionals and attorneys familiar with this insurance practice told CNN that patients who receive money from insurers typically cannot be held criminally responsible if they never turn the cash over to their provider. But the patients can be held financially responsible.Though many patients send the money on to the providers, they said, others might realize they're onto a bonanza, pocketing the money and ducking and dodging every time a doctor or medical office reaches out. Many are simply confused as to why they're receiving money. Candyce Ayn, a Georgia resident who recently underwent surgery with an out-of-network doctor, said she received more than $3,500 from Anthem, but she said that amount paled in comparison to the more than $240,000 sent to a family member by Anthem after a surgery a few years ago. The large check was surprising, she wrote in an email. It was more than we had paid for our house!Checks are still arriving for her recent surgery, she said; adding to the confusion, the checks were made out to her spouse, the main policy holder. She also said Anthem didn't make clear or explain why the money was sent.Checks arrived for partial amounts, some were for amounts different than expected, and I received more checks than I had anticipated, she said. She paid her providers, she said, and she believes that most patients are probably like her. Maybe there is a small percentage who think 'Vegas, here I come!' but I believe it is mostly confusion on the patient's part and not at all malfeasance. Especially if there are many checks involved and they have not had the experience of going 'out of network' before. She's thankful to have insurance, but putting the checks in the patient's name introduces an opportunity for things to go wrong.   Insurance companies also make it hard for doctors, hospitals and other providers to know whether a check has been issued to a patient, refusing to disclose the information, according those familiar with the insurance practice. One Blue Cross letter, shared with CNN, told a provider that the insurer doesn't have the authority to disclose the financial information and that we are only able to instruct the provider to contact their patient.Sometimes, it pushes health care professionals to file suit against patients. I can tell you categorically that a health care provider never wants to be in a position of having to sue one of his patients for money that should've been paid by the patient's insurance company, said David King, a Nashville attorney who regularly represents providers in disputes with insurance companies. This insurance company practice unnecessarily brings its own member into the dispute -- and forces the provider to pursue the patient for the money.Cathryn Donaldson, a spokeswoman for the insurance advocacy group America's Health Insurance Plans, defended the practice of insurers sending checks to patients, saying it's because insurance companies don't have a contractual relationship in place with the hospital, physician or care provider. She also took issue with the term paying patients, saying that reimburses is more appropriate.In the case of out-of-network care, I want to be clear that the term 'revenge tactic' is inaccurate and not reflective of how health insurance providers handle out-of-network costs, Donaldson said. She added that insurance companies are , because out-of-network doctors, hospitals and specialists charge whatever rates they like, resulting in millions of patients receiving surprise, unexpected medical bills that can often break the bank.NYU's Caplan found the idea of sending money to patients ludicrous. You're going to be giving out these sums of money that a lot of people never see in a year and tell them their duty is to shift it over to the out-of-network service provider? he said. You can't be serious. In a country where the vast majority of people live paycheck to paycheck, Caplan said, such policies would put most anyone in a moral and ethical bind, because it's ridden with almost irresistible temptations.There's a temptation, I suspect, to take the money and run, Caplan said. I can certainly empathize with the temptation to not play ball. ... I just think that's a ludicrous burden to put on the individual.Barbara L. McAneny, president of the American Medical Association, blasted what she called insurance bully tactics that seek to force physicians to go in-network -- tactics that she said have become more widespread as insurance companies have grown in size and power.Physicians want the ability to negotiate fairly with larger health insurers without fear of strong-arm tactics that antagonize patients, McAneny said in a written statement to CNN. She said many health insurers ignore assignment of benefits agreements between patients and physicians, deciding to send payments straight to patients.The reality is that insurers refuse to recognize these agreements to create a market advantage for themselves against physicians who do not participate in the insurer's network, McAneny said.Kantor put it this way: How can you run a business and stay in it if you can't get paid?Kantor is representing , which closed last year amid financial woes and a federal probe and after being accused of fraud by another insurance company -- allegations it has disputed in a countersuit.  The case against Anthem and its Blue Cross entities has been tied up in litigation for years. Kantor recently joined the case on behalf of provider Sovereign Health, streamlined it and began focusing on the payments she said went directly to patients. She filed a motion in late January targeting the $1.3 million she says went to patients from 2012 to 2015. She said they are waiting for a hearing on the amended complaint.In one case, a woman from Washington state received nearly $375,000, Kantor said, and the treating facility tried for more than a year to recover the money from the patient. She said a Blue Cross entity sent more than 50 checks to the woman between August 2014 and May 2015 after she sought treatment over five months in 2014. We don't know what happened to the money in this case, Kantor said. We just know that Sovereign, our client, didn't get any of it.It's also not clear what became of the woman, she said.In another case, a man in New York sent his fianc\u00e9e's daughter for two months of treatment at an out-of-network facility in San Diego in late 2014, Kantor said. The man is alleged to have received more than $130,000, including one check worth $79,700.I don't know about you, but seeing a check for $80,000, I think, would ring alarm bells in my head, said Tim Rozelle, an attorney working with Kantor. Anthem lost an anti-assignment case in federal court last year. A Los Angeles-area hospital sued the insurance company, accusing it of an act of retaliation for not agreeing to the insurer's unreasonably low contract rates.The Martin Luther King Jr. Community Hospital accused the insurance giant of engaging in this practice knowing that in many instances the patients will not forward the checks to their healthcare providers or otherwise use those funds to pay for their healthcare services. The hospital documented three patients from the same place of work who sought emergency care, complaining of chest pains and other ailments dozens of times. The insurance company paid those three individuals a total of about $250,000, the suit said. During one deposition, Eric Chan, the attorney for the hospital, pressed the human resources director who helped administer the health plan for the three workers about the plan's intent. The intention of the plan isn't to enrich the employees, to give them bonuses, in addition to receiving medical care, is it? Chan asked.No, it's not, the HR director said. But she acknowledged that she had no idea Anthem sent money directly to employees until the lawsuit arose.Anthem's director of group contracts and compliance said under oath that patients get paid directly by Anthem if they go out-of-network because the benefit is theirs. By contrast, the in-network providers get reimbursed directly, the Anthem representative said in her deposition.  In a ruling against Anthem, US District Judge Otis Wright described the predicament the hospital was put in: Plaintiff realized that these individuals had no intention of paying their hospital bills and were instead profiting from Anthem's practice of sending checks directly to patients.However, Plaintiff could not turn these patients away because under both state and federal law Plaintiff is obligated to treat every individual who presents to its emergency room in good faith.The judge entered a final judgment in December, ordering Anthem and the other defendants to pay the hospital more than $400,000. Anthem has appealed the decision. Last year, the hospital agreed to go in-network with Anthem -- a sign, critics said, that the insurance giant's overall strategy worked.Sam Fenderson, a surgical assistant in the Atlanta area, said Anthem's tactics have very real consequences for providers like him. He said that about $147,000 owed for his services over the past three years was sent to patients, and it's been draining trying to recover the funds. That was really frustrating, because the payment was there, he said. It was just a matter of the patient sending the payment on to me.He said he's had to go to the extraordinary measure of suing 17 patients to try to get the money. He said four people declared bankruptcy, meaning he couldn't try to recoup that money. Some of the other cases are still in small-claims court.While most counties view the issue as a civil matter, Fenderson said, he's found one county in Georgia that considers it a crime when patients keep the cash. Newton County considers it theft by conversion felony for amounts over $1,000; prosecutors said they've charged two people in the county.When his patient in that county was threatened with arrest, Fenderson said, the money was turned over rather quickly.Suing a patient to get money, he said, is a last resort and not the way we want to operate. The tactic even creates tension among surgical staff: Some surgeons get angry if you sue patients, Fenderson said, because they still need to see the patients for followups. But if you don't act, he said, you're working for free, essentially.He said the issue seems to be more common now than just a few years ago. This is not something that's just happening to me, he said. Hundreds of people I work with are going through the same thing.Kantor said she hopes her case shakes up the system. We're going to have to change what Anthem does, she said."},
{"title": "She lost her dad when she was 14. Now, she's helping kids learn how to mourn.", "cate": "health", "content": "When Tracy Crosby's husband died unexpectedly, she suddenly became a single mom to four young children.  The hardest thing in the world is to tell your children that they're never going to see their other parent again, she said.  Her children would cry a lot at bedtime because they missed their dad. Crosby worried about how they would cope long-term. and studies show they are at .   To avoid that fate for her kids, each month Crosby takes her family to , where they learn how to deal with their grief with other children who have lost a parent, brother or sister.  It's really nice to have people listen to you who actually understand what you're going through, said Crosby, who has been going to Imagine for a year and a half. It's huge to have that support system.Mary Robinson founded the nonprofit in 2011 to create what she didn't have after her father died from cancer when she was 14. As a result, her grades dropped, she quit her activities and became withdrawn.It looked like bad behavior ... But it was a textbook example of a grieving child, Robinson said. I wasn't a bad kid. I was a sad kid.Robinson struggled until she got help in her late 20s. Eventually, she began volunteering at a children's grief support group and nearly two decades ago, she quit her job to devote herself to the work full-time.  I really do this work to make sure other kids don't lose years of their life to unresolved grief, she said. The death of a parent is really a trauma for a child. But it doesn't have to leave a child traumatized if they get support.At Imagine, support starts with a pizza dinner, giving everyone a chance to socialize. Then family members and volunteers form a circle and pass around a talking stick, introducing themselves and saying who they've lost.  Naming the loss is actually an important part of mourning, Robinson said. It also normalizes your loss and your grief. So, kids see that every single person has had somebody who died. And that's incredibly powerful.The gathering then breaks up into age groups. Through games or arts and crafts activities, like making Memory Boxes, children and teens are encouraged to open up and share with the volunteer facilitators. A realistic hospital room gives children whose parents suffered long-term illnesses a unique way to work through their feelings, while others let off some steam in the Volcano Room with its padded walls, pillows for punching and books for ripping.It's a place for kids to come and erupt like a volcano, Robinson said. It's a safe way to release their angry feelings ... and it makes it easier for kids to talk and express themselves.Parents also support each other and learn ways to help their children mourn. They know (their kids) have entered this new at-risk category, so they're wondering 'What do I do?' Robinson said. So, we say, 'Here's simple ways to listen that help kids open up and here are ways to be a role model for how to cope.'At the end of the night, everyone holds hands in a circle and a squeeze makes its way around one by one. The experience leaves Crosby and her children feeling positive.They're always so excited to go, Crosby said. To know that they're so happy, and they have the opportunity to talk about their dad ... it makes me feel like I'm doing the right thing.My priority is that I raise happy, emotionally healthy children ... and Imagine can help me do that.For Robinson, that's the goal.I feel just such a sense of joy that this exists for them, she said. I think my dad would just be really glad that I made something good come out of the grief and the pain of losing him. So, I think he's really proud.CNN's Kathleen Toner spoke with Robinson about her work. Below is an edited version of their conversation.You have a certain symbol that can be found throughout the center. What's its significance? In every single support group room, we have elephants -- they're part of murals, stuffed animals, pillows. That's because in our society, grief and loss are the one thing that isn't talked about. We are afraid of people who are grieving because we don't know what to say or what to do. But here at Imagine, you talk about the elephant in the room.Is there a time limit on the services you provide? No. That's because children re-grieve, and as they grow older, they miss their parents in a whole other way. When a 5-year-old's dad dies, he misses him in one way. When he starts Little League at 10 and sees lots of other dads around, he might get angry and start acting out. They need support at different stages of development. Some families stay for years, some only six months -- but they are always welcome to come back. There's no time frame to grieve, and it's different for everybody. What are some other ways Imagine is helping people?   We are going to be opening a center in Newark in April. It's only 20 minutes away from us, but it's an urban community that's a world away in terms of resources. Children there are experiencing a lot of trauma in their lives. So, we're really thrilled about working there. We also provide grief education in the schools. You have classrooms full of grieving students and yet nobody prepares teachers for how to deal with that. So, we go in to help the teachers and staff understand that there's things that they can do to support them. I believe the world is driven by unresolved grief. Walk into any therapist's office, 12-step meeting or prison and you will hear stories of grief and loss. Loss is part of life, but nobody teaches us what do you do when you have all these feelings. My goal is to help kids develop coping tools and create supportive communities that can support anybody who is grieving."},
{"title": "Tattoo therapy: How ink helps sexual assault survivors heal ", "cate": "health", "content": "For Olivia Adamson, her body artis a visual reminder I am still alive. And still OK. What she particularly likes is the ability to touch it: the words unbreakable on the right side of her left foot and survivor in her aunt's handwriting on the inside of her left wrist. If I am having a hard time, as soon as I touch my wrist and I run my finger over my word 'survivor,' it helps.Adamson, 24, of Austin, Texas, was sexually assaulted in November 2015 and in January 2016. In both cases, she knew the perpetrator. Her onlysupport network was her aunt, she says, and she got the survivor tattoo as part of the healing process. Once I got the tattoo, I knew that it was going to help in ways that I couldn't help myself heal, she said. Like many other sexual assault survivors, Adamson found getting tattooed to be a therapeutic experience. Without her tattoos symbolizing her experiences, I really don't know where I would be.December Maxwell, 38,knows this feeling well. She is a survivor of childhood sexual assault and published a in Januaryon the phenomenon of survivors getting tattoos as a way to heal from trauma.Maxwell, a Ph.D. student at the University of Texas in Arlington, spoke to 10 sexual assault survivors about the motivations behind their tattoos and found that they have very different reasons than the general population. Previous  shows that in different cultures, tattoos symbolize membership in a group, signify status or commemorate a major life event. For the people in Maxwell's study, getting tattoos was very therapeutic.The participants got their first tattoos between the ages of 11 and 29 and had three each, on average. Some acquired their first body art after their assault.A sexual assault is an infringement on your body, Maxwell said. But by marking their skin in their own way, people are able to redefine their relationship with their bodies. This is a cathartic experience, she said, and some people in her study didn't realize how much they were holding on to their pain until they went through the process of selecting art that carries meaning for them and was designed to symbolize their experience. Reclaiming their bodies also allows people to shed the identity as a victim and move toward being a survivor, Maxwell explained. Cierra Barefoot, who was sexually assaulted at 13, has the , resembling the outlines of a rose and the shape of fire. She was inspired by American pop star Lady Gaga to tattoo this design beneath her collarbone.Lady Gaga has publicly discussed her sexual assault in the past, revealing she was raped at 19 and was diagnosed with . During her  Oscar performance, she asked 50 sexual assault survivors to join her on stage, and some had gotten the geometric rose tattoos as a sign of unity.Since then, the design has become a symbol for sexual assault survivorsBarefoot was inspired by Lady Gaga's 2016 performance, and said the fire rose tattoo gives her power over her own story. I'm proud of being a survivor, said the 22-year-old from Pittsburgh. Shifting perceptions away from victim to survivor is important for processing the event and moving on or becoming sexually involved again, Maxwell added.Many survivors look to tattoos to help them overcome the trauma because they view it as an alternative healing method.Maxwell likens this to traditional art therapy, in which people have to draw something related to how they feel and engage with their experiences in that way.But unlike art therapy, a lot of participants talked about how the pain was part of the [healing] process, Maxwell said. Similar to meditation, the physical pain of the needle will force people to be present in the moment; they can't avoid their thoughts. People also have to focus on their breathing, as with a marathon or exercise class -- both methods often used to deal with trauma, she added. This helps people slow down and think about their pain and how to cope with it.Adamson, who has the unbreakable and survivor tattoos, agreed: Therapy, sometimes it helps, and sometimes it doesn't. It depends largely on the therapist and how understanding they are. In her case, she felt like therapy was not helpful. Instead, she focused on accepting the experience in her own way. To put it in ink, on your body, for me, is the best way to let some of it go, she said. Last year, Adamson was in a physically and sexually abusive relationship, after which she got a bow tattoo on her right wrist to symbolize being held together. Adamson added that she believes it is important for people to not hide behind what has happened to them. She decided to share her story wanting people to know it's OK for others to know what has happened.Feeling that therapy isn't helping isn't uncommon, according to Maxwell. It can be difficult to find a therapist who specializes in sexual assault treatment, especially if you're looking for a female therapist.The women in her study felt stigmatized because they're survivors of sexual assault, and because of their body art. Some felt uncomfortable going to a traditional therapist because of those stigmas.That made some sexual assault survivors look for alternative healing methods -- like tattoo, writes Maxwell's study.According to the Rape, Abuse, and Incest National Network, on average, there are victims of rape and sexual assault every year in the United States. A  found that 35% of women across the globe have experienced either physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence or non- partner sexual violence.During an assault, the fight, flight or freeze instinct takes over, explained Anne McKechnie, a consultant forensic clinical psychologist based in Glasgow, Scotland. Once the immediate threat is gone, the information has to be assimilated into the memory banks, said McKechnie.During this assimilation period, it is normal to feel distressed or agitated, to have trouble sleeping and experience intrusive thoughts or to completely avoid the incident, she said. The brain is just essentially accommodating that new information and beginning to understand it, according to McKechnie, who was not involved in Maxwell's research.A person's reaction to assault may also depend on whether they have been repeatedly assaulted or by things like childhood adversity, she added. When we make sense of something that's happened to us, we are able to move on and create a memory. That might hurt a little bit when we go there, but actually, it's something that we can largely live with, McKechnie explained.  This is where tattoos come in. If they are a way for survivors to take back control and accept that what has happened is not their fault, they can be beneficial, shesaid.Barefoot said her survivor tattoo has helped her not feel shame. It's a reminder that I am not broken or tainted from the abuse. Alongside therapy, her body art was one of the coping mechanisms. Barefoot was also motivated to get her tattoo in order to start a conversation. 'I want to educate people on sexual assault, she said, how it changes people's lives and pretty much can almost destroy them. Barefoot explained that she was comfortable telling her story because if just one victim sees this and is able to start their own healing process and gets help then she knows that she has made the right decision.But in the absence of other coping mechanisms, a tattoo will not solve the problem, McKechnie said. We should never, ever aim to have just one way of coping. We need to see coping as a variety of tools in a toolbox.Another concern is that people might see tattooing as a distraction. While you're coping with physical pain, your brain isn't doing that processing of the memory that it needs to do to be able to move on, she said. Maxwell agrees that processing trauma through tattoos needs to happen in line with other therapy. She added that tattoos have the potential to become maladaptive: unhelpful behaviors that hinder people from adjusting healthily. You can't get a tattoo every time you process something, she added.Barefoot likes that her body art gives her the chance to educate people. When someone's gaze lands on her tattoo, it opens a conversation about the meaning and allows her to open people's eyes to the topic of sexual assault. I'm proud of being a survivor, and I'm proud of being able to educate others and open a conversation with this tattoo."},
{"title": "What 'Medicare for All' means, politically and practically", "cate": "health", "content": "If you've been watching the Democratic presidential hopefuls gear up, you have probably heard the phrase Medicare for All. Medicare, which has been around since 1965, is the government-run health insurance program that covers all Americans 65 and older and is funded by taxpayers. A portion taken out of our paychecks for Social Security goes toward Medicare to cover most services like hospital stays and doctors' visits. People on Medicare can also choose to get additional coverage from Medicare-approved private insurers to cover other services such as dental, vision and prescription drugs.Proponents of Medicare for All want to expand this program to cover more than just Americans 65 and older. Some, such as Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, are pushing for Medicare to cover all citizens and lawful permanent residents, while others such as Michigan Sen. Debbie Stabenow are pushing to lower the age requirement. In 2017 she introduced a bill to allow people between 55 and 65 years old to buy into the program. Earlier this month Stabenow introduced another bill further lowering the age requirement to 50. Many of those pushing for Medicare for All believe that health care is a human right, and many supporters believe that getting more people into the Medicare system can help rein in growing costs in the US health care system. It's worth noting that Medicare is quite popular as it stands now. In a  from December, of those Americans publicly insured through Medicare or Medicaid (the government's health program that covers those with limited income), 79% say they are happy with the quality of their health care and believe that they have good to excellent health coverage. The concept of a government-funded health care system isn't new. Efforts to provide some sort of universal health coverage in the United States date all the way to 1904, when the Socialist Party endorsed the idea.In Republican President Theodore Roosevelt ran for a third term as a Progressive Party candidate; his platform included a single national health service. Even though he lost, the concept of a single-payer system would continue to make its way into political discussion. Some of the strongest resistance to a nationalized health care system  who feared that it would interfere with their profits.  Teddy's cousin President Franklin Roosevelt would try to pass a universal national health insurance program as part of the Social Security Act in 1935, as part of the New Deal. President Harry Truman continued to push for it during his time in office. According to the , fear of socialism and a panic by Southern Democrats that a nationalized health care system would require desegregation ultimately thwarted the health care efforts. It came back to prominence when Sanders included it as part of his 2016 presidential platform. He didn't win, but the idea took off with a number of Democrats. In fact, it also has some support from Republicans. According to a recent Kaiser Family Foundation poll, of Republicans support the idea of federally provided health insurance. In September 2017, Sanders and 16 Democratic co-sponsors introduced a Medicare for All expansion bill to cover all Americans. The co-sponsors included California Sen. Kamala Harris and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, who are running for president in the 2020 election. When announcing her run, Harris said, I'm announcing once and for all that health care is a fundamental right. And we will deliver that right with Medicare for All!Theirs wasn't the only bill to try to expand Medicare. In the last congressional session, there were at least eight other proposals introduced in the House and the Senate aiming to expand the program. Some would have expanded the program by lowering the Medicare age eligibility to 55; other bills added a Medicare option while maintaining private insurance choices.Last summer, Democratic Rep. Pramila Jayapal of Washington helped found the Medicare for All Caucus, which now has 78 Democratic representatives as members. And throughout the recent midterms, Medicare for All was a rallying cry for Democrats. It was heard from the likes of now-freshman New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Rep. Harley Rouda of California, who beat 15-term Republican incumbent Dana Rohrabacher. And it wasn't a campaign platform limited to the coasts.  won her first term by promising, I will fight for Medicare for All. Our health care system could best be described as a hybrid. About half the money comes from the private sector: people who have private insurance through their employers or who are self-insured. The other half is from the public sector: federal, state and local governments paying into Medicare and Medicaid. If the country adopted Sanders' proposal, people who currently get their insurance from their employers would move to the government system. Sanders' plan would cover basic health services, as Medicare does now, and include dental and vision coverage with no copays. The only potential for out-of-pocket fees would be for some prescription drugs and certain elective procedures. If states wanted to fund additional benefits for their residents, under the Sanders proposal, they could, but they would have to do so without federal assistance.Aside from getting more people access to health care, supporters of Medicare for All say that moving to this system would create efficiencies to help bring down costs of health care. The US health care system now costs nearly  what other high-income countries pay, per capita.As long as your doctor was state-licensed and a certified Medicare provider, your visit would be covered. But if your doctor chose not to participate in Medicare, you would have to either pay out of pocket or see a participating doctor. Under the comprehensive Sanders program, the only things you would probably have to pay for would be certain elective and cosmetic procedures. But the devil is in the details, and many of those details still need to be hammered out. For example, Medicare has contracted with and approved certain private insurers to provide additional coverage. Would a Medicare for All system be a tiered system with supplemental insurance, similar to what we have now, or would the private insurance industry go away completely? It depends on which proposal were to be approved. Also, keep in mind that Medicare pays doctors and hospitals less than private insurers for services, and not all hospital systems or doctors accept Medicare. The found that private health plans pay hospitals about 45% more than treatment costs, while Medicare and Medicaid pay about 12% less than costs, a difference of 57 percentage points  If we moved to a Medicare for All system, would all hospitals and doctors agree to this pay cut? Would they organize to demand more? These are the kind of questions that architects of an expanded system have to wrestle with.If Sanders'  were to become law, it wouldn't happen overnight. It would roll out over four years. In the first year, Medicare would grow, with the eligibility age dropping to 55 and with all children 18 and younger added to the rolls. Over the next two years, the age would drop to 45 and then 35. By the fourth year, it would truly become Medicare for all.This is where the rubber hits the road and one of the reasons it's such a contentious issue.The graph below illustrates the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services' projections for health care spending from 2017 to 2026.There are several numbers to consider when we think about health care costs.1. That's the yellow line in the graph. It represents how much we as a country spend on things like drugs, doctors visits and hospital care; including all sources of funding, both public and private. In 2017, the cost of health care was $3.5 trillion. Over the decade from 2017 to 2026), the cost is expected to be $45 trillion.2.  This purple line represents the federal government's share of national health care spending, which includes Medicare and Medicaid. Much of this comes from taxes. In 2017, federal health care spending was $974 billion. Over 2017 to 2026, federal health care spending is projected to be $13 trillion. 3.  That's the green line, federal health care spending plus what states and local municipalities pay. It represents about half of total national health care spending; the other half comes from the private sector. In 2017, total government spending was $1.56 trillion. Over the decade from 2017 to 2026, total government spending is projected to be $21 trillion.Sanders' analysis was based on 2016 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services health expenditure projections.  CNN used Sanders' assumptions and applied the same savings ratios to the most current projections in this analysis of Sanders' data. 1. Using , under Medicare for All, national health care spending for 2017 would have been just about $3.2 trillion. Over the decade  from 2017 to 2026, Sanders' total national health care spending would have been close to $39 trillion.  Keep in mind that Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services projected that national health care spending under our current system is about $45 trillion from 2017 to 2026. If Sanders' assumptions are correct, Medicare for All would lower national health care spending by about $6 trillion over the decade. Sanders believes that those savings would largely result from reduced administrative costs, reduced payments to physicians and lower prescription drug prices resulting from a single-payer system.2.  Sanders doesn't make a distinction between federal and state spending in his analysis. All of his spending is considered federal or public, since under the Medicare for All plan, the federal government is largely the single payer. Sanders' analysis assumes that if Medicare for All had been implemented in 2017, in that year, federal spending would have been approximately $2 trillion, and total public or federal spending would have been about $27 trillion for the decade 2017-26. But again, Sanders estimates that total national health care spending under Medicare for All would have hit $3.2 trillion for 2017 and about $39 trillion over the decade, meaning Sanders still would need an additional $12 trillion to $14 trillion to cover national health care spending for the decade. To pay for his plan, Sanders called for a new 2.2% income tax on all Americans and a 6.2% levy on employers. He would also increase taxes on the wealthy. But, he argues, people would save money because they would no longer have to pay copays, monthly premiums or deductibles. A family of four earning $50,000 would save more than $5,800 each year, he said. Sanders says that while everyone will pay more in taxes, they will make up for that by paying less in premiums in out-of-pocket expenses for health care.Some experts believe that Sanders' picture is too rosy, overestimating how much savings would result from the single-payer system. Critics also worry that he has underestimated the increased cost from more people using health services. There are now about  uninsured Americans, and it shouldn't come as a surprise that providing insurance for that many more people will be expensive. A recent Pew Research Center poll found that Americans believe that it is the federal government's responsibility to make sure all Americans have health care coverage.The left-leaning Urban Institute  that, over the same 10-year period, under the Sanders plan, national health care spending would increase by more than $6 trillion over what we are projected to spend by 2026. It also projected that national health care spending would be closer to $51 trillion, instead of Sanders' projection of $41 trillion. That means an additional $32 trillion in new federal spending, according to the Urban Institute's estimate.Other experts, including Kenneth Thorpe, chair of health policy and management at Emory University's Rollins School of Public Health, also take issue with Sanders' estimates. No matter how the cost is cut, everyone will be affected, Thorpe said, and Sanders' proposed tax hikes couldn't cover the $32 trillion increase.Thorpe believes that sales taxes would have to increase, on top of the other tax hikes Sanders has called for, to get to the needed $32 trillion. And that would affect everyone. Sales tax is a regressive tax, meaning it will affect the poor more than the rich.Thorpe knows this not just because he's an economist and has Sanders' 2016 plan but because he was chosen by the Vermont legislature in 2005 to analyze potential blueprints for a single-payer system in the Green Mountain State. There will be winners and losers, he explained. And who may end up paying more might surprise you.According to Thorpe, someone already on Medicare or Medicaid who is paying very little, if anything, in premiums would probably start paying more taxes and potentially see no relief, or offset, on premiums. The reason is that what they are paying in taxes is potentially greater than their current premiums.Small-business owners could be in a similar boat. If they have fewer than 50 employees, they are currently not paying premiums for their employees. But they would pay more in payroll taxes and not see any relief, or offset on premiums. Canada and Taiwan are often cited as examples of other places that have single-payer health care systems under which all residents are insured. Those governments pay for health care through taxes on their citizens. In Canada, the federal government provides only health care, and dental, vision and prescription drugs may be covered by the province or through private insurers. Britain's National Health Service is also often used as an example of a single-payer system. But in the English system, the government not only pays for services, it contracts with and employs doctors and hospitals directly. This is considered socialized or nationalized health care. In Canada and Taiwan, and under Medicare in the United States, the government doesn't own or contract the providers.  The British system is more akin to the US Veterans Administration.Another country that frequently comes up as a model in the health care debate is France, which has a mix of public and private insurance.  Although most of France is covered by one of the three not-for-profit health insurance funds financed by the government and covers between 70% and 80% of costs, there are private supplemental insurers, as well. All of these countries provide almost universal health care, through which insurance is either provided or mandated by the federal government. In the United States, for every one doctor, there are about 16 staff members -- but only six of those staff members actually have clinical roles, like nurses' aides or medical assistants. That's more than in labor costs per doctor. Unlike in countries that have a nationalized or single-payer system, the United States has hundreds of health insurance providers, with different codes and different rates all for the same procedures. It's administratively inefficient if the same knee replacement can be processed and charged in dozens of ways. The cost of lifestyle diseases, such as obesity, is staggering in the United States. There are  that 80% of diabetes, heart disease and stroke and 40% of cancer cases are preventable. By  as many as 1 in 3 US adults is expected to be diabetic. We also spend way more on technology and drugs. Pharmaceutical drugs are particularly costly in the United States, partly because the largest user of prescription drugs -- Medicare -- can't negotiate prices down with drug manufacturers. Under Sanders' plan, the government would come to the table to broker pricing. Patients in the US health care system tend to have a lot more unnecessary tests and procedures than patients in other countries, and that all adds up to a high price tag. It's in part due to profit motivation, as well as a phenomenon known as defensive medicine. That's when doctors and hospitals are overly cautious and perform tests and scans out of fear of ending up out of the operating room and in the courtroom. In 2008,  cost the United States $55.6 billion in health care costs.According to the nonprofit National Academy of Medicine, in 2009, of all health care costs was a complete waste and did nothing to make Americans actually feel better. This proposed expansion isn't just popular with politicians; it has a lot of support from their constituents. A Kaiser Family Foundation survey from January found that of Americans support Medicare for All.Public support also depends how you qualify the program. Remind people that it will eliminate health insurance premiums and reduce out-of-pocket health care costs for more Americans, and support for the program spikes to 67%. If you tell people that Medicare for All guarantees health care as a right for all Americans, approval for the program jumps to 71%. But remind them that it could eliminate private insurance, and support flips. According to the poll, 58% of Americans would oppose Medicare for All if it got rid of private insurance. Sixty percent of respondents said they opposed the single-payer system when they were told that it would raise taxes for most Americans. Take control of your health. Eat better. Exercise.Chronic conditions such as heart disease, cancer, diabetes and obesity are among the most prevalent and costly in the United States. Six in 10 Americans has at least one chronic disease; 4 in 10 have two or more.  Americans with five or more chronic conditions make up 12% of the population but account for  of total health care spending. These Americans spend 14 times more in health care than those with no chronic conditions. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, chronic diseases account for  of all health care spending. These conditions are the leading factors of our nearly $3.5 trillion in health care spending. CNN's Nadia Kounang and Tami Luhby contributed to this report.

{"title": "Jurors say Roundup contributed to a 2nd man's cancer. Now thousands more cases against Monsanto await", "cate": "health", "content": "A federal jury dealt a huge blow to Monsanto, saying its popular weedkiller Roundup was a substantial factor in causing a California man's cancer. It's the second time in eight months that a jury has reached such a decision. But Edwin Hardeman's case against Monsanto is the first to be tried in federal court. And thousands of similar cases are still pending at the federal or state level.  We are very pleased that the jury unanimously held that the Roundup caused the non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Hardeman's attorney Jennifer Moore said. It was a hard, long-fought battle against Monsanto. And for Mr. Hardeman to have his day in court and to show that Roundup does cause cancer.But this trial isn't over yet. While the first phase focused on whether Roundup caused Hardeman's cancer, the second phase -- which begins Wednesday -- focuses on whether Monsanto is liable. Bayer, the parent company of Monsanto, insists that glyphosate -- the key ingredient in Roundup -- is safe.  We are disappointed with the jury's initial decision, but we continue to believe firmly that the science confirms glyphosate-based herbicides do not cause cancer, Bayer said in a statement. We are confident the evidence in phase two will show that Monsanto's conduct has been appropriate and the company should not be liable for Mr. Hardeman's cancer.Bayer said the jury's verdict Tuesday has no impact on future cases and trials because each one has its own factual and legal circumstances.It's unclear how much the jury might award Hardeman in damages, if anything at all. But last August, in the first state trial over whether Roundup can cause cancer, California jurors awarded  in punitive and compensatory damages. A judge later reduced the total award to. But Johnson's attorney Timothy LItzenburg said his client has not seen much of it because Monsanto is appealing. Johnson's case was the first to go to trial because doctors said he was near death. And in California, .Litzenburg said he and other attorneys have more than 4,000 similar cases awaiting trial in various state courts. One advantage of filing in state court rather than federal court is that state courts often produce outcomes faster -- which can be critical for terminally ill patients.But Hardeman's case is in federal multidistrict litigation, or MDL.MDL is similar to a class-action lawsuit because it consolidates pre-trial proceedings when there are multiple plaintiffs, for the sake of efficiency.But unlike a class-action lawsuit, each case within MDL gets its own trial -- with its own outcome.In other words, one MDL plaintiff might get a large settlement, while another plaintiff might get nothing.Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patients who used Roundup started suing Monsanto by the hundreds after a World Health Organization report suggested glyphosate might cause cancer.The 2015 report, by WHO's International Agency for Research on Cancer, said glyphosate is .But Monsanto has long maintained , and said the IARC report is greatly outnumbered by studies saying glyphosate is safe.  More than 800 scientific studies, the US EPA [Environmental Protection Agency], the National Institutes of Health and regulators around the world have concluded that glyphosate is safe for use and does not cause cancer, Monsanto Vice President of Strategy Scott Partridge said in August.He highlighted the , which concerned the effects of glyphosate products on farmers from 1993 to 2013. A  said no association was apparent between glyphosate and any solid tumors or lymphoid malignancies overall, including NHL (non-Hodgkin's lymphoma).In most cases of lymphoma, the cause is unknown, according to the . Yet critics question whether Monsanto has had undue influence over regulators.In a 2015 internal company email, a Monsanto executive wrote that an EPA official at the time offered to help quash another agency's review of glyphosate, saying . But a Monsanto spokeswoman said .While debate continues over whether glyphosate is safe, parts of the country are limiting or banning it, said the US Public Interest Research Group Education Fund. Following the state court decision last year, we saw a huge uptick in local ordinances that would regulate the use of Roundup on playgrounds, schoolyards and public parks, said PIRG's , who leads a campaign to ban Roundup. For example, the city of Miami just banned the use of glyphosate. With this decision [Tuesday], we expect to see the same explosion in awareness.CNN's Jennifer Selva contributed to this report. "},
{"title": "There's new advice to prevent food allergies in children", "cate": "health", "content": "Giving a baby a new food to try is fun, and it should be. The only concerns parents should have: finding their phones fast enough to document the funny faces and cleaning up the mess that might follow. Yet in recent years, scientific evidence has accumulated quickly on what foods to introduce when and how to best prevent allergies -- leaving parents to keep track of it all. On Monday, based on a detailed review of all available evidence on the topic, the American Academy of Pediatrics published  on what works and what doesn't when it comes to the prevention of food allergies and other allergic conditions. The new guidelines continue to liberalize the introduction of what are thought to be highly allergenic foods such as peanuts, fish and milk.There is no convincing evidence that delaying the introduction of allergenic foods beyond 4 to 6 months of age works in preventing food allergies, the report says. In addition, there is strong evidence that purposeful, early introduction of peanuts as early as 4 months may prevent the development of a peanut allergy in infants at high risk, defined in this report as those with a close relative with a history of an allergic condition.  There is no reason to delay giving your baby foods that are thought of as allergens like peanut products, eggs or fish, Dr. Scott Sicherer, a co-author of the report, said in a statement. These foods can be added to the diet early, just like foods that are not common allergens, like rice, fruits or vegetables.The gastrointestinal tract is home to a unique set of immune system cells, and when these cells are given a taste of the allergenic proteins in different foods, they take up these proteins and become tolerant to them. Dr. David Stukus, a pediatric allergist and associate professor of pediatrics in the Division of Allergy and Immunology at Nationwide Children's Hospital, said that's true as long as it's introduced early and in an ongoing fashion, meaning there is a critical window of time during which being introduced to these foods may lead the body to become tolerant. And early means as soon as 4 months to 6 months of age, said Stukus, who was not involved with the new guidelines.The report also looked at whether breastfeeding protects against eczema, wheezing, asthma and food allergies. Exclusive breastfeeding for the first three to four months of life was found to be protective against eczema, the authors concluded. Any amount of breastfeeding beyond that time, even if not exclusive, was found to be protective against wheezing in the first two years of life and asthma in the first five years and even later. The report says no conclusion could be made when it came to breastfeeding and its effect on the prevention of food allergies. No evidence was found that avoiding allergenic foods during pregnancy or during breastfeeding worked in the prevention of allergic conditions. Neither did the use of special hydrolyzed formulas, even in kids who were at high risk. I really appreciated the comprehensiveness of this clinical report, said Dr. Wendy Sue Swanson, a general pediatrician and chief of digital innovation at Seattle Children's Hospital. Swanson, who has long advocated for the early introduction of a diversity of foods in young children, described feeling grateful for the guidance, given the ongoing changes in the understanding of allergy prevention. In 2000, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended delaying the introduction of cow's milk until children were 1 year old, egg until 2 years and peanuts, tree nuts and fish until 3 years.  Recommendations were to avoid allergenic foods until children were older, Stukus said. The thought process at the time was, well, if we avoid any exposure, maybe the allergic response won't develop.In 2008, after a review of the available literature, the organization issued a report saying there was no convincing evidence that delaying allergenic food introduction prevented food allergies. The report did not give specific guidance as to when these foods should be introduced. Almost 10 years later, after a study was published in the New England Journal of Medicine, the academy recommended that babies at high risk of developing peanut allergies be introduced to peanuts as early as 4 months. Infants considered at high risk included those with eczema and/or an egg allergy. This study -- known as the Learning Early About Peanut or LEAP trial -- showed that children at high risk of developing peanut allergies who are introduced to peanuts at 4 months to 6 months old had a significantly lower risk of developing a peanut allergy than those who waited until they were 5 years; 1.9% of the kids who had peanuts early developed an allergy, compared with 13.7% of the kids who waited. The LEAP trial formed the basis for Monday's new recommendations, which encourage the early introduction of peanut products in infants at high risk for allergies.But most babies are not at high risk, and peanuts are just one of the eight culprit foods; the others are milk, eggs, fish, crustacean shellfish, wheat, soy and tree nuts, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The latest report explains that the same mechanism that protects infants at high risk is likely to protect infants at low or standard risk of developing food allergies. A study that examined these other foods, known as the  or EAT trial, recruited 1,303 3-month-olds and randomly assigned them to receive six allergenic foods -- peanut, cooked egg, cow's milk, sesame, whitefish and wheat -- at that age or to wait until 6 months. The team then measured whether these infants developed food allergies between 1 and 3 years old. Only 40% of parents were able to keep up with the diverse food frequency that the study protocol recommended. When researchers looked at the data from all of the children in the study, no difference was found in the rates of food allergies. When they looked at only the children whose parents had been able to keep up with the foods, there was a significantreduction in peanut and egg allergies. The EAT study provides some evidence but is less strong than the LEAP trial evidence, said Dr. Elizabeth Matsui, pediatric allergist and chairwoman of the American Academy of Pediatrics Section on Allergy and Immunology, comparing the trial that included the different foods to trial that involved peanuts. When the risk of an illness is relatively low, proving that it can be decreased even further is very difficult, she added. An important takeaway from the trial is that introducing a variety of foods as early as 4 months is safe, Stukus explained. Overwhelmingly, the data is pointing toward the benefit of early food introduction, Swanson said.  I don't want kids to delay introduction. Stop medicalizing this and let babies eat, she added.  It's not just early introduction. It's routine feeding. It's habituating. We need to make a habit of eating very diverse foods, Swanson said. It's a great habit to have your whole life, because 50% of people who develop a food allergy develop it in adulthood.In his practice, Stukus has started to recommend early introduction -- between 4 and 6 months of age -- of allergenic foods for all babies, no matter their individual risk. He encourages parents to continue to give these foods several times a week for babies who are tolerating them. I think the benefits far outweigh the risks in this situation, he said.  The most serious risk is anaphylaxis, a severe allergic reaction that can be life-threatening. But in most young infants, Stukus explains, anaphylaxis manifests as vomiting and hives, without the difficulty breathing and the closing airways that can be seen in older children. Parents who spot vomiting or hives -- especially together --  should still seek medical attention. But pediatricians and parents alike can rest assured that these foods can be introduced freely at home, reversing decades of fear in the introduction of new foods, he added.   We come from a place of restriction and medicalization, Swanson said. Pediatricians were strong in telling parents to be cautious, and now they must be strong in telling parents not to be cautious. No, I don't want you to be cautious. In fact, waiting might cause harm, she said."},
{"title": "An Ohio court is being asked to clarify when life begins in lost embryo case", "cate": "health", "content": "An Ohio lawyer, representing a couple that lost three frozen embryos in a fertility clinic storage tank malfunction, is asking a court to clarify when life begins. Bruce Taubman is scheduled Wednesday to appear before a three-judge panel in the 8th Ohio District Court of Appeals to argue on behalf of his clients Wendy and Rick Penniman. The Pennimans, of suburban Cleveland, were among the more than 950 families affected by the tank failure last March at Cleveland's University Hospitals Fertility Clinic. That malfunction caused the temperature to rise, destroying more than 4,000 eggs and embryos.The key question we want to be answered is: when does life begin? Taubman wrote in  last April. The Pennimans believe that life begins at conception, and that means that their embryos that were destroyed by UH (University Hospitals), are, in fact, people. However, the decision must be based on law, not emotion. Seeking a legal declaration that life begins at conception, Taubman sought a declaratory judgment from the court, which would allow the embryos to be treated as persons and former patients, not property, under Ohio law.If the legal status of embryos is not declared to be that of a person, the Plaintiffs will not be able to bring a cause of action for wrongful death and will not be able to seek relief for the mental anguish incurred by the Plaintiffs as surviving parents, Taubman wrote in his original complaint last year.Attorneys representing University Hospitals filed a motion to dismiss the case, which was granted by the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas last year. Taubman filed an appeal, which prompted Wednesday's hearing.This Court must hold that an embryo that has not been implanted into the uterus does not constitute a 'distinct human entity' and thus is not entitled under the law of Ohio to the rights and protections of a person, Judge Stuart Friedman wrote in his opinion.Parents may believe that the embryos thus created are already persons -- but that is a matter of faith or of their personal beliefs, not of science and not of law, continued Friedman, who retired from the trial court in early January. And while they may feel the anguish of a parent who has lost a child ... the court can deal only with rights and obligations that the law recognizes, not with emotions, feelings, or beliefs of individuals.CNN repeatedly tried to interview Taubman in recent days, but he was unavailable. In his appeal, though, he argues that Ohio law is ambiguous and contradictory when it comes to defining personhood and when life begins. He also says the lower court erroneously relied on a criminal statute while looking at a civil matter.He points out how Ohio law does not unequivocally establish that embryos are excluded from the definition of persons. And, he writes, the term person 'includes an individual, corporation, business trust, estate, trust, partnership, and association.'  That broad definition, he argues, does not define the word individual, which makes it reasonable to believe that embryos are included within this definition of a person. At the same time, he adds, a person is also defined in Ohio law as an unborn human who is viable. What viability means for embryos is different from fetuses and should be taken into account, he says. An unborn human is further described in Ohio law as an individual organism of the species of Homo sapiens from fertilization until live birth, he writes, which highlights a contradiction.Asserting that an organism is an unborn human from fertilization means that life begins at the moment of conception, he says in the appeal. The law cannot ... say that the life of a human begins at fertilization and then deny personhood to those humans the law deems are not viable. Lawyers for the University Hospitals, on the other hand, argue that the law is clear.Settled law establishes that an unborn child is not a person under the Ohio Constitution and Ohio common law unless the unborn child is a fetus who can live outside the womb, they write in their appeals brief. A cryopreserved embryo stored in a crytotank at -160 Centigrade, which is neither a fetus nor in a mother's womb, is not a person under Ohio law. Suggesting that viability should be redefined for embryos is pointless, they add. Ohio criminal law defines 'an unborn human who is viable,' as a 'person' and, in turn, defines viability as 'the stage of development of a human fetus at which there is a realistic possibility of maintaining and nourishing of a life outside the womb with or without temporary artificial life-sustaining support, they say.What this means is there is no ambiguity, they say: A frozen embryo is not a person, nor does it have legal rights.The defense team hopes the panel of judges in the appeals court will affirm the trial court's decision, while Taubman hopes the court will reverse the previous decision -- either allowing for further court proceedings or issuing its own declaratory judgment that life begins at the moment of conception. Both sides present their arguments Wednesday afternoon in court. It may be months, though, before the court issues a decision. "},
{"title": "Spaceflight is activating herpes in astronauts ", "cate": "health", "content": "The longer astronauts spend in space, the more likely they are to have viruses like herpes, chickenpox and shingles reactivate, according to new NASA research. The reason may be the same for viral reactivation on Earth: stress.Samples of blood, urine and saliva were collected from astronauts before, during and after short space shuttle flights and long-term International Space Station missions. Herpes viruses reactivated in more than half of the astronauts. The study published last week in the journal .To date, 47 out of 89 (53%) astronauts on short space shuttle flights, and 14 out of 23 (61%) on longer ISS missionsshed herpes viruses in their saliva or urine samples, said lead study author Satish K. Mehta at Johnson Space Center. These frequencies -- as well as the quantity -- of viral shedding are markedly higher than in samples from before or after flight, or from matched healthy controls.Shedding is when a virus successfully reactivates.On both short and long-term spaceflight missions, astronauts undergo exposure to zero gravity, cosmic radiation and extreme G forces during take-off and re-entry. Added to this is confinement in small spaces, social separation from family and friends and an altered sleep cycle, the researchers said. Spaceflight creates a stressful environment for the astronauts, awakening dormant viruses. Four of the eight human herpes viruses were detected, including oral and genital herpes, chickenpox and shingles. Because the herpes viruses take up residence in nerve and immune cells, they're never really gone, so they can wake up.But luckily for the astronauts, the reactivation of the viruses doesn't necessarily mean that the symptoms return.Only six astronauts developed any symptoms due to viral reactivation, Mehta said. All were minor.But the implication for infecting others when the astronauts return to Earth is very real, especially those with compromised immune systems or newborns. Evidence of infectious chickenpox and shingles were still apparent in body fluids up to 30 days after the astronauts returned. The researchers are also looking ahead to future space missions, which will take them on long-term trips to the moon and Mars through deep space. A round-trip mission to Mars could take up to three years.The magnitude, frequency and duration of viral shedding all increase with length of spaceflight, Mehta said. The ideal countermeasure is vaccination for astronauts -- but this is so far available only against chickenpox.The trials of other herpes virus vaccines show little promise, so the researchers are focusing on developing targeted treatment regimens for individuals suffering the consequences of viral reactivation.This research has tremendous clinical relevance for patients on Earth too. Already, our spaceflight-developed technologies for rapid viral detection in saliva have been employed in clinics and hospitals around the world, Mehta said.Some of the , like muscle and bone loss. The astronauts combat this with increased exercise while they're on station.In January, researchers looked at the  of astronauts. Specifically, they studied the effects of six months of spaceflight on a type of white blood cell that kills cancerous cells in the body called natural killer cells. These NK cells also prevent viruses from reactivating. Cancer is a big risk to astronauts during very prolonged spaceflight missions because of the exposure to radiation, Richard Simpson, senior study author and University of Arizona associate professor of nutritional sciences, said in a statement. [NK-cells] are also very important to kill off virally infected cells. When you're in the space station, it's a very sterile environment -- you're not likely to pick up the flu or a rhinovirus or some community-type infection -- but the infections that are a problem are the viruses that are already in your body. These are mostly viruses that cause things like shingles, mononucleosis or cold sores; they stay in your body for the rest of your life, and they do reactivate when you're stressed.During the study, the scientists studied blood samples from eight astronauts who spent time on the space station and compared them to healthy people who have not endured spaceflight. The astronaut blood samples were taken before, during and after spaceflight. Compared to the healthy controls and how they were before flight, the astronauts' NK cell-function was impaired during and after spaceflight. On day 90 of their stay on the space station, samples of NK-cell activity against leukemia cells in cultured dishes was reduced by 50% in crew members.The effect was even greater in astronauts who went to space for the first time, compared to those who had previously flown missions.  I don't think there's any doubt that NK-cell function is decreasing in the spaceflight environment when analyzed in a cell culture system, Simpson said. But what caused this to happen? Just like in the new study, the researchers in this study believe it could be stress-induced. The first-time astronauts were also younger than the spaceflight veterans, and found their first experience more stressful, which could exacerbate their cell response. The study is not implying that astronauts are more susceptible to cancer. On that question, future studies may tell. The next question would be, how do we mitigate these effects? How do we prevent the immune system from declining during space travel? Simpson said. In order to do that, you have to first figure out what's causing the decline: Is it stress? Is it microgravity? Is it radiation? Is it a plethora of things? When we figure that out, we can try to find ways to directly target those factors and mitigate them.Researchers at Johnson Space Center are working on possible countermeasures, including exercise, nutrition-based and pharmacological, to keep astronauts healthy in space. These could all boost immune response. "},
{"title": "Drinking very hot tea almost doubles risk of cancer, new study says", "cate": "health", "content": "Many people start their day with a cup of tea. But those who drink it piping hot could be increasing their risk of esophageal cancer, according to a new .Researchers found that tea drinkers who liked their beverage to be warmer than 60 degrees Celsius (140 degrees Fahrenheit) and consumed more than 700 ml of tea per day -- about two large cups--  had a 90% higher risk of esophageal cancer, when compared to those who drank less tea and at cooler temperatures.The study looked at more than 50,000 people in Golestan, a province in northeastern Iran.Many people enjoy drinking tea, coffee, or other hot beverages. However, according to our report, drinking very hot tea can increase the risk of esophageal cancer, and it is therefore advisable to wait until hot beverages cool down before drinking, said Dr. Farhad Islami, of the American Cancer Society and the study's lead author. Previous has found a link between hot tea drinking and esophageal cancer. This study,  published Wednesday in the International Journal of Cancer, was the first to pinpoint a specific temperature, according to the authors. is the eighth most common cancer in the world and is often fatal, killing approximately 400,000 people every year, according to the International Agency for Research on Cancer.  It is usually caused by repeated injury to the esophagus due to smoke, alcohol, acid reflux and -- maybe -- hot liquids.The esophagus is a long tube through which swallowed food and liquids travel to reach the stomach. Theestimates that 13,750 new cases of esophageal cancer will be diagnosed in men and 3,900 new cases in women in the United States in 2019. The team of researchers followed 50,045 people, aged between 40 and 75, for an average of 10 years. Between 2004 and 2017, the researchers detected 317 new cases of esophageal cancer. The study said more research was needed on why exactly drinking very hot tea is associated with the higher risk of esophageal cancer.Stephen Evans, a professor of pharmacoepidemiology at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said that it was the heat that was the issue rather than the type of beverage. In fact, it is probably anything hot: Microwaved jam has been known to cause esophageal injury.  It is possible that the trauma leads to cell changes and hence to cancer, he told the Science Media Centre. Evans was not involved in the study.In the United States and Europe, tea is rarely consumed at temperatures above 65 degrees Celsius (149 degrees Fahrenheit) -- but in places like Russia, Iran, Turkey and South America, it is common to drink tea that hot or even hotter.If you go to the Middle East or to Russia, they drink it out of a samovar that's constantly under heat, said Peter Goggi, president of the Tea Association of the USA. It's very, very hot.Dr. James Doidge, senior research associate at University College London, said that hot drinks were an established risk factor for esophageal cancer.It doesn't take a scientist to appreciate that repeated irritation of any body surface increases your risk of cancer. Sunburn gives us skin cancer, smoking gives us lung cancer, and many foods and drinks contribute to risk of gastrointestinal cancers, Doidge, who wasn't involved in the research, told the Science Media Centre.

He and City Attorney Dennis Herrera announced a four-pronged initiative that includes legislation which, if passed, could ban the sale of e-cigarettes that haven't undergone premarket review by the US Food and Drug Administration, . This would include sales in brick-and-mortar stores, as well as online sales shipped to a San Francisco address.City officials cited vapes' popularity among youth as a key reason for introducing these measures. The city  -- alongside officials from New York and Chicago -- and said it allowed these products to temporarily remain on shelves without undergoing premarket review for their impact on public health. The San Francisco ban would not apply to e-cigarette products that have undergone this review -- but so far, none have.Walton is introducing legislation that would prohibit the sale, manufacture and distribution of all tobacco products, including e-cigarettes, on City property, according to the statement. In tandem, Herrera is requesting information on why Juul's headquarters at San Francisco's Pier 70 has a license to distribute tobacco products even though the company maintains it doesn't sell such products on premises. If the company is found to be in violation of their lease or any laws, that could result in legal action -- including getting kicked out of the building.It seems somewhat curious to me that they have a distributor's license when they say they are not doing any distributing, manufacturing or sale on property, Herrera told reporters. At this point we don't have any evidence that they are in violation of the terms of their lease agreement, he added. If I find that they are in violation, then I would take action.In a statement, Juul Labs said that this proposed legislation's primary impact will be to limit adult smokers' access to products that can help them switch away from combustible cigarettes.We encourage the City of San Francisco to severely restrict youth access but do so in a way that preserves the opportunity to eliminate combustible cigarettes, the company continued, maintaining that it  to limit kids from using their products.Last week, the  its deadline for e-cigarette companies to submit applications for premarket review to August 8, 2021 -- and not the following year, as is the current case.The agency released a policy draft that, if finalized, would take action against stores selling flavored e-cig products that are accessible to minors and against websites selling them without verifying buyers' ages and limiting the maximum quantities they sell. in November that vaping had increased nearly 80% among high schoolers and 50% among middle schoolers since the year before.

{"title": "New study suggests fish oil derivative may benefit heart health", "cate": "health", "content": "New numbers suggest that a purified fish oil derivative, a prescription drug called Vascepa, is more effective at preventing cardiovascular events than previously thought.The drug lowered the rate of these events in high-risk patients -- including strokes, heart attacks and deaths from cardiovascular causes -- by 30% overall versus placebo, according to a  published Monday in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology.This is better than previously thought because because the study authors took into account not just first cardiovascular events as before, but also second, third, fourth events, and so on. Earlier results were  by Irish drugmaker Amarin Pharma in September and then in a  released November in the New England Journal of Medicine.By looking only at first events, we underestimate the true underlying treatment benefit offered, study author Dr. Deepak L. Bhatt said in a  Monday.With this drug, we are not only preventing that first heart attack but potentially the second stroke and maybe that third fatal event, said Bhatt, executive director of interventional cardiovascular programs at Brigham and Women's Hospital and professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School.According to these latest data on cardiovascular episodes, Vascepa slashed first events by a quarter, second and third events by more than 30%, and later events by almost a half. The researchers estimated that by treating a thousand patients for five years, they could prevent 76 coronary revascularizations, 42 heart attacks, 14 strokes, 16 hospitalizations due to unstable angina and 12 deaths related to cardiovascular causes.The study was funded by Amarin. The drug was previously  by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2012 to lower triglycerides, a type of lipid, in excess of 500 mg/dL. Vascepa is a prescription drug derived from a single omega-3 fatty acid isolated from fish. Patients received four grams per day, which Bhatt described as the rough equivalent of eating more than 20 servings of fish a week, according to the Monday statement. However, eating that much fish would also add saturated fats and other ingredients to one's diet, the statement followed.Amarin gave early wind of the drug's positive results in a September , boosting company shares from $2.99 to more than $12.At the time, experts said the initial findings were not widely expected. The science behind fish oil and cardiovascular health has been inconclusive, and many studies have not shown a benefit. Fish oil studies have produced ambiguous results, but this component ... carries significant effect, said cardiologist Dr. Russell Luepker, a Mayo professor of public health at the University of Minnesota who was not involved in the trial. He said the latest results show certainly more clear outcomes than just taking fish oil capsules.In September, Luepker initially reserved judgment on the drug but now has a more positive view.The number of events prevented is not trivial, he said shortly after attending a presentation on the drug at a meeting of the American College of Cardiology on Monday. It gives more meaning to something that many of us have suspected for years: that triglycerides are important, and treating people that have high triglycerides is a useful thing.But cardiologist Dr. Rita Redberg raised additional concerns, saying in an email that a number of unanswered questions remain. For example, the most common events in the study were coronary revascularizations -- procedures like stents that bring blood flow back to the heart. However, she said this can be quite subjective and done at the discretion of the investigator without objective criteria. She also expressed concerns about how closely involved Amarin was in all aspects of the study, which may cast a large shadow of bias, said Redberg, a professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco who was also not involved in the trial.It is premature to recommend Vascepa, she said. We should stick with our strong evidence-based recommendation to eat a Mediterranean style diet, including several servings of fish per week, to reduce cardiovascular risk.Luepker also pointed out the prescription drug can cost in the ballpark of  per month, which is not inexpensive, and said it was important to recognize who was represented in the study.The 8,179 patients in the study had LDL levels in the normal range, controlled by statins, as well as elevated triglycerides. In addition, they either had established cardiovascular disease, or they had Type 2 diabetes and at least one other cardiovascular risk factor. Patients were followed for a median 4.9 years.The new study describes the drug as well tolerated with no significant differences in rates of serious adverse events versus placebo. The researchers did find an increased risk of irregular heartbeat and bleeding, that was not linked to other serious events like stroke.Additional questions remain about how the drug actually works. Experts say it's unclear whether the drug prevents cardiovascular events by acting directly on triglycerides or whether they are a marker for some other process going on in our bodies. Or perhaps some combination of the two.Roughly a quarter of Americans age 20 and older have elevated triglycerides, according to data from the . High triglycerides are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease in combination with low HDL and high LDL, according to the . The agency says lifestyle choices -- including exercise, weight loss, diet and quitting smoking -- can help lower triglycerides.  is the top cause of death in the US, leading to the deaths of more than 600,000 per year."},
{"title": "'The Trump Dynasty' distills president's life into A&E documentary", "cate": "entertainment", "content": "As with all things pertaining to Donald Trump, people will surely project their preconceived notions onto The Trump Dynasty, a three-part, six-hour A&E documentary presented under the Biography banner. This deep dive into the president's life is nevertheless well worthwhile -- especially through the first two parts, which offer a detailed guide of the people and events that shaped him.Perhaps foremost, the documentary (really about 4 \u00bd hours sans commercials) features a wide array of Trump's friends, critics and biographers, while drawing upon not only the rich video evidence that's available but rare material like audiotaped interviews conducted with him. If there's one primary takeaway it's the manner in which Trump assiduously built his brand, which included aggressively cultivating the press that he now regularly derides.The title notwithstanding, Trump Dynasty is perhaps too grandiose a title for a project that focuses pretty steadfastly on a single person. That said, the narrative does reach back to his grandfather, who came to the US in 1885, profitably running a restaurant/hotel that catered to miners during the Klondike Gold Rush, an enterprise whose services included prostitution.The documentary covers Trump's youth in some detail, including the lessons he learned from his father, Fred, a successful real-estate tycoon, and the federal lawsuit brought against them for in housing in 1973.Still, the more significant thread stems from Trump's relationship with attorney Roy Cohn, the one-time right hand of Sen. Joe McCarthy, who became a sort of professional father figure to Trump. Cohn provided a guide for dealing with the rough and tumble of New York politics, and among other things, introduced Trump to Roger Stone, the political operative who urged Trump to run for president. (Stone, who was  in Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe, is among those interviewed.)The small details, asides and video snippets are among the most interesting. Newspaper columnist Linda Stasi recalls that Trump would call you up and plant stories (there's audio of him calling a reporter in the guise of PR rep John Baron). Editor Tina Brown notes that the press loved him because he was so accessible, adding wryly that Trump Tower -- an edifice to his ambition -- was the Liberace of buildings.Trump's personal life also receives its share of attention, with the random footage that includes his wedding to Marla Maples, with Howard Stern and O.J. Simpson conspicuous among the guests.Tony Schwartz, Trump's collaborator on The Art of the Deal, and now a staunch critic, discusses how the book set him up for national celebrity. The documentary also devotes time to Trump's older brother, Fred Jr., who battled alcoholism before dying in 1981 at age 43 -- a series of events that reportedly left a mark on Trump.Granted, much of this won't come as news to those who have closely followed Trump's career. But for those less well-versed in his life before The Apprentice helped emboss his image as only hit primetime series could, it's a nicely constructed look at Trump's colorful life, laying the groundwork for his improbable shift from the status of celebrity businessman to the Oval Office.The list of more than 60 interviewees runs literally from A to Z -- from journalists Kurt Andersen and Ken Auletta to Melania Trump friend Paolo Zampolli -- and also covers the political gamut, including Fox News' Sean Hannity and MSNBC's Lawrence O'Donnell.For all that, The Trump Dynasty is likely to be a virtual Rorschach test, with one's view of Trump going in likely determinative in terms of which parts seem most significant. That filtering of the same presentation of facts through the prism of partisan opinion is, perhaps, one of the most indelible aspects of the Trump legacy."},

You are competing with devices that sit in people's hands that capture their attention every 15 minutes.Streaming services are still gunning for that one signature breakout hit, but they will need a lot more content to keep a global audience engaged, according to Nathanson.But volume alone isn't enough. Stankey's boss, AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson, has implied that prestige is an important factor for success. He knocked Netflix by comparing it to Walmart, while .Jill Rosengard Hill, an executive vice president at Magid, a research-based media firm, told CNN Business that the future of subscription TV will probably be a mix of quality and quantity.Streaming services need volume with both diverse originals and a large library of acquired shows and movies to give the consumer more bang for their subscription bucks, she said.Sonia Saraiya, , believes that HBO's Watchmen may have the best shot at being the next big thing because it's helmed by Damon Lindelof who has proven to be a good storyteller. He was a co-creator of Lost and already has really successful source material. My guess is that what makes something be the next 'Game of Thrones' is something that really goes in a totally different direction, Saraiya said.

Could alkaline water provide any special health benefits? There's really not a lot of evidence either supporting of the health claims that are made about alkaline water or refuting the claims, Malkani said. In other words, the jury is still out.Malkani noted that if all the body systems are functioning as they should be, the blood pH isn't going to vary too much. So it's a misconception that you can, by drinking an alkaline water, drastically affect the pH of the body.Illnesses are common causes for . Diabetes can make your blood more acidic, but kidney problems can make it more alkaline. Certain foods, including dairy products, also can make your blood more acidic.It is more common for companies to manufacture alkaline water, but natural alkaline water can occur when water picks up minerals from areas such as springs, when it passes over rocks in the environment.Alkaline compounds are salts and metals that, when added to water, make it more basic, Malkani said.All in all, the general consensus among health experts for now is that making sure you are drinking enough water is more important than the type of water you prefer.The  recommend that men drink an average of about 3.7 liters (125 ounces) of water each day and that women drink about 2.7 liters (91 ounces).

Steven Spielberg wants to preserve the theatrical experience. Those two points of view are clashing, with Netflix pushing back against a plan that Spielberg reportedly has to create rules that could block the streaming giant from future  contention.It's the old guard versus the new guard, said Jeff Bock, senior box office analyst at Exhibitor Relations. We're at a crossroads on how people are enjoying their entertainment.Netflix on Sunday night responded to Spielberg's reported plans by tweeting from its film unit's , We love cinema.The company said in its tweet that it also loves...Access for people who can't always afford, or live in towns without, theaters; letting everyone, everywhere enjoy releases at the same time; giving filmmakers more ways to share art.These things are not mutually exclusive, Netflix Film tweeted.Netflix did not mention Spielberg by name, but the tweet came after Hollywood trade publication  reported last week that the Oscar-winning director was devoted to ensuring that the race never sees another 'Roma' \u2014 a Netflix film backed by massive sums, that didn't play by the same rules as its analog-studio competitors.It's not clear what rule changes Spielberg might be planning to propose at the Academy's annual board of governors post-Oscar meeting. But a spokesperson for Spielberg's production company, Amblin, told IndieWire that Steven feels strongly about the difference between the streaming and theatrical situation. A spokesperson for Amblin declined CNN Business' request for comment.Spielberg, who is a member of the Academy's board of governors and one of the most powerful people in Hollywood, has previously said he thinks that films that forgo a theater run or have a limited theatrical release shouldn't be in contention for Oscars.Once you commit to a television format, you're a TV movie, Spielberg told  last March. I don't believe that films that are given token qualifications, in a couple of theaters for less than a week, should qualify for the Academy Award nomination.He took a shot at Netflix last month during an awards acceptance speech  I hope all of us really continue to believe that the greatest contributions we can make as filmmakers is to give audiences the motion picture theatrical experience. I'm a firm believer that movie theaters need to be around forever.For Netflix, an Oscar can be used to court talent and help create more exclusive content for subscribers. It can also make Netflix's method of releasing films the industry norm. Netflix has been releasing its original films on its service at the same time they are in theaters, and sometimes does not release them in theaters at all.That's a threat to the bottom line of the theater industry, which makes it money from the box office and concession sales.Netflix released Roma in theaters exclusively for three weeks in November before it premiered on the service, a significant difference from the standard 90-day window that studios typically adhere to before making a movie available to rent or stream. Roma is currently still in theaters. Films have to be in the theaters for at least a week in order to be eligible for an Oscar nomination.For Spielberg and other creators who want to preserve theatrical windows, it's also about sending a message to streamers that movie theaters still matter, especially if you want to win Hollywood's biggest awards.Amazon has stuck by the 90-day theatrical window with its acclaimed hits like Manchester by the Sea before releasing it on its Prime video service. However, Amazon Studios head Jennifer Salke  that the studio has plans to look at a variety of windows to release its films going forward.Spielberg's rule changes may curb that talk.It also could have an impact on one of this year's most anticipated movies, The Irishman -- a Netflix film starring Al Pacino and Robert De Niro that could be a major player at next year's Oscars race. The Irishman may get a wide theatrical release,  to the Hollywood Reporter.Netflix declined to comment on this story beyond the tweet.Netflix was in the running for 15 Oscars at this year's Academy Awards, including a first-time Best Picture nomination for Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n's Roma. Roma ended up taking home three awards including one for Best Director. The reports of Spielberg taking on Netflix also sparked debate online about the future of movie-making.Director Ava DuVernay, whose film When They See Us premieres on Netflix later this year, posted on Twitter that she values Netflix because it distributes black work far/wide. 190 countries will get WHEN THEY SEE US, she . I've had just one film distributed wide internationally. Not SELMA. Not WRINKLE. It was 13TH. By Netflix. That matters.Spielberg is one of the most influential figures in Hollywood, but Bock believes he and much the old guard may be fighting a losing war.What does the audience want? Bock said. Spielberg is holding the line of what cinema is, but no one person gets to decide that. The audience does."},
{"title": "Ricky Gervais mixes comedy and grief in bittersweet 'After Life'", "cate": "entertainment", "content": "Comedy and crippling grief might seem like strange bedfellows, but Ricky Gervais mostly makes the odd juxtaposition work in After Life, a melancholy series that continues the writer-director-star's relationship with Netflix.Gervais' TV output has taken a darker turn since The Office, with the brilliant Extras followed by the less successful Derek. As an outspoken atheist, his new show deals with weighty subject matter -- namely, how to process death and loss without the comfort that religion brings to our understanding of them -- while still veering, sometimes awkwardly, into quirky comedic situations.Here, he plays Tony, a reporter for a small newspaper (the strange people he meets working on human-interest features provide much of the comedy) devastated by his wife's death due to cancer.It broke me, he confesses in a later episode. I just don't see any point in living.Those around Tony try to tiptoe around his fragile emotional state, beginning with his brother-in-law (Tom Basden), who also happens to be his boss. But the main conceit is that Tony's indifference to carrying on becomes a kind of super power, as he puts it, allowing him to say precisely what he thinks and occasionally put himself in harm's way when the situation calls for it.At first, there's not much fun in hanging around with a character who's both surly and suicidal, prone to sulking as he watches videos of his late spouse, while being introduced via a series of unpleasant encounters with random people. About the only creature he shows any affection is his dog, even snapping at the kids who attend school with his nephew.Gradually, though, rays of hope begin to emerge as Tony sleepwalks through his days -- meeting a wisdom-dispensing widow (Downton Abbey's Penelope Wilton) at the cemetery, experimenting with drugs and trading barbs with the nurse (Extras co-star Ashley Jensen) attending to his aging father (The Strain's David Bradley), who is in throes of dementia.Gervais' comedy generally thrives on a brand of misanthropy, pushing to the edge of that bleak assessment of human nature before stepping back from the abyss. So when Tony says early on There's no advantage to being nice, and thoughtful, and caring, it's basically serving notice that After Life will involve the process of building toward finding some reason to believe otherwise, however hopeless it all might appear at first.Tony's uneven evolution is perhaps an inevitable side effect of contemplating existential issues within the confines of this six-episode format. Ultimately, though, Gervais has produced a series that tackles the biggest of questions and darkest of thoughts in a characteristically uncomfortable, relatively modest and ultimately satisfying manner."},
{"title": "'Five Feet Apart' injects new wrinkle into ill-teen romance", "cate": "entertainment", "content": "The dying teen/young-adult romance is such a familiar Hollywood genre that websites can devote lists to it. So Five Feet Apart -- an earnest story about two teens afflicted with cystic fibrosis -- must be viewed within that context, which offers a solid showcase for its young leads, Haley Lu Richardson and Cole Sprouse, while laboring to flesh out a complete movie.Basically, the format of these films provides uplift through grief, struggle and the threat of a premature death -- a longer version of the song Live Like You Were Dying.In this case, it's a message conveyed pretty overtly, where the romance's bittersweet aspect is expanded by the hurdle that literally compels the characters to stay apart and magnified by the fact both have grown up under CF's shadow.Marking the directing debut of Jane the Virgin co-star Justin Baldoni, Five Feet Apart came about through a documentary series that he produced, My Last Days, which profiled young people dealing with illness.The movie tackles the explanation of its central conundrum through YouTube videos that Stella (The Edge of Seventeen's Richardson) posts about her disease. While hospitalized for treatment, she meets Will (Riverdale's Sprouse), who is brooding and distant at first, before the two gradually begin to fall for each other.The problem, and it's a big one, is that those with cystic fibrosis are especially dangerous to each other, causing hospital personnel (embodied by a caring nurse, played by Kimberly Hebert Gregory) to mandate that they must remain six feet apart at all times. How to fall in love, then, without actually touching?The nagging imposition of that physical gap creates a palpable tension throughout the movie, prompting the rule-following Stella to push back against the guideline, even if it's only by a symbolic foot.There's an undeniable poignance in the concept of young people living with the specter of death constantly at their shoulders, making it impossible to be normal kids. For Stella, there is the prospect of a lung transplant, while Will has entered into a clinical trial, providing at best wispy rays of hope.We're breathing borrowed air, Will snaps during his surly stage, before the two creatively find ways to romantically spend time together, which isn't easy within the sterile confines of a hospital.Therein, ultimately, lies the real challenge for Five Feet Apart, which can't help but feel a trifle claustrophobic, while endeavoring -- often through musical montages -- to tease out the details of a relationship that begins with We have nothing in common and appears destined to end in tears.Richardson, in particular, shines in the role. Yet the small-boned nature of these stories explains why in days of yore they primarily flourished as TV movies -- the medium through which Five Feet Apart, after its theatrical release, is most likely to be seen.Of course, Romeo and Juliet established the template for star-crossed lovers long ago; still, the star in Five Feet Apart might be more of an asterisk, one signaling that its young stars have bigger things in their futures."},

{"title": "'The Case Against Adnan Syed' extends 'Serial' mystery", "cate": "entertainment", "content": "The hunt for another true-crime sensation has been pretty unrelenting since Making a Murderer, but HBO cheats a bit with The Case Against Adnan Syed, essentially a sequel to Serial, the hugely popular 2014 audio documentary.As a consequence, this new four-part project ends up rehashing much of the case, while picking up where Serial left off in a way that weaves the media attention the original generated into the story, in much the way that the second season of .It is, for the most part, an engrossing account, although the filmmakers employ one extremely questionable device to help illustrate what had only been heard, not seen, using animation as a visual aid during voiceover excerpts read from murder victim Hae Min Lee's diary.Serial producer Sarah Koenig is shown accepting a prestigious Peabody Award for the podcast, marveling that she would be honored for devoting so much time to an old murder that I did not solve.As dense as Serial was, there's ample material for filmmaker Amy Berg to sift through, tied to the 1999 disappearance and murder of the 18-year-old Lee, and the eventual arrest and conviction of her former boyfriend, Adnan Syed.For starters, their hidden relationship speaks to cultural strictures -- she was Korean-American, he the son of Pakistani immigrants -- that created impediments to their relationship, issues that Lee addresses at some length in the diary entries.Mostly, though, The Case Against Adnan Syed operates as a mystery, raising the question of what happened to Lee, potential missteps by the Baltimore police and who -- if not Syed -- might have killed her, in the midst of an appeals process that won him the right to a new trial before bogging down in the courts. (Last week, Maryland's Court of Appeals allowing Syed a new trial, reversing an earlier decision in March 2018.)Like Making a Murderer, there's a good deal of time devoted to forensic minutia, like analyzing the grass at the location where Lee's car was found. The search also includes returning to interview high-school friends, and hunting down another of Lee's former boyfriends, while retaining a private investigator to help reexamine the evidence. One of the high-school contemporaries, Krista Meyers, expresses concern that Hae gets lost in the focus on Adnan and whether he was wrongly convicted, an inevitable byproduct when filtering such fact-based stories through the demanding prism of an entertainment culture weaned on Law & Order and CSI.Once again, The Case Against Adnan Syed raises troubling questions about the justice system, including the questionable behavior of police amid pressure to close high-profile cases. (It's also worth noting that Syed family friend and advocate Rabia Chaudry is credited among the producers.)The docu-series is not, perhaps, as compelling -- or certainly as unique -- as the podcast was. Three of the four installments were made available, so it's also to be determined how well the producers do in bringing this installment of the story to a conclusion, given the status of the case.Even so, for those who tuned into Serial, the new documentary makes a convincing argument for its own existence, in what has become, for better or worse, one of TV's most crowded genres."},
{"title": "Remember when 'The Oprah Winfrey Show' made us listen to each other", "cate": "entertainment", "content": "The Oprah Winfrey Show used to air at 4 p.m. every day on my local station in South Texas. Because my elementary, middle and high schools were mere minutes from our family home -- and I was, at times, a bit of a truant -- Oprah Winfrey and I spent countless after-class hours together during the late '90s and '00s. At first, I would tune in because she was my favorite celebrity interviewer, and I would feel a twinge of disappointment when I'd come home and find her couch occupied by someone whose faces and names I didn't recognize. But as the years went on, the episodes about common men and women would become my favorite for the same reason that Winfrey was quickly recognized as a one-of-a-kind talent: she made you care deeply about strangers and understand experiences that weren't your own. Her talk to people vs. talk at people approach and the way she shined light in the darkest corners of subjects like sexual abuse and racism, made The Oprah Winfrey Show a unique television experience -- one that presently feels absent on daytime and broadcast television. (Or anywhere on TV, really.) This, at a time when political and ideological divides could use a bridge-builder and when Americans could use a daily housecall from someone whose message has always been empathy.If the country doesn't need Oprah in the White House; maybe it needs her back on the talk show stage.It is a tantalizing thought, admits Mark Harvey, director of graduate programs at University of Saint Mary and author of Celebrity Influence: Politics, Persuasion, and Issue-Based Advocacy. There's so many variables there. One, obviously, is: Are we living in a different country than we did when Oprah had her TV show? I think the answer's yes. When Winfrey signed off her show in 2011, she explained her departure without frills. It was just the right time, she told TV Guide before beginning her farewell season. Always a forward-thinker, she also admitted she wanted to leave when I felt the platform was still vital and held some kind of meaning in the hearts and minds of the audience.Winfrey's prediction proved true. Since her exit, broadcast talk television no longer wields the influence it once did as people have turned to digital platforms to find conversations once reserved for a stage and a captive studio audience of 300-plus. A heart-tugging human interest story that would have once found attention on Winfrey's program can now reach millions thanks to a viral video. And need a layered, in-depth discussion about race? There's a great podcast -- or 10 -- about that. Politically, American viewers have also retreated to their television corners, Harvey says, including Fox News and MSNBC.Back then you had Republicans and Democrats and there were differences, but they weren'tin open war practically, he says. Could [Winfrey's] voice compete with those other forces that are out there? I mean, that's hard to say. He continues: In order for her to have an effect against these polemic forces, she would probably haveto be fairly outspoken, and may actually have to take a side one way or another and in a way, that may be really off-putting to your opposition. JeffriAnne Wilder, a sociologist and scholar who specializes in diversity, race relations and women's empowerment, says today's television viewers are searching for so-called confirmation bias. We just want to hear someone who agrees with what we have to say, she says. We aren't necessarily looking for or searching out perspectives that are different from ours.For the record, people across the political spectrum generally like Winfrey. A found that the majority of voters, 52%, said they viewed her favorably. A whopping 72% of Democratic voters gave the mogul a favorable rating, while 51% of independents and 30% of Republicans agreed.Winfrey claimed at a 2007 rally for then-candidate Barack Obama in Des Moines, Iowa, that she has historically voted for as many Republicans as Democrats. What helped Winfrey avoid the perception of taking sides during her show's run was her ability to be a simultaneous convener, connector, but also an agitator, according to Wilder.I think she presses her audience -- whether or not they agree with her -- to be accountable for what their perspective is, she says. I think she does push her audience in a way that's very distinctive from anyone else who has graced the talk show stage. Winfrey similarly challenged her guests, and did so again just a few weeks ago when the mogul found herself commanding a crowd for a television special called After Neverland, a discussion about the HBO documentary Leaving Neverland. In the special, which one could imagine being an episode of her former talk show, Winfrey spoke with Wade Robson and James Safechuck, two men whose allegations of sexual abuse by Michael Jackson were the subject of the four-hour documentary. (The Jackson family has disputed all the allegations and condemned the film as a public lynching.)Though Winfrey herself became the target of backlash from Jackson's defenders for participating in the special, to her credit, she asked tough questions of her subjects about whether money was a motivator in telling their stories and why the film didn't feature an interview with anyone appearing in the late singer's defense.Winfrey, who has been open about her own history with sexual violence, also made it clear why she was there.  For me, this moment transcends Michael Jackson, Winfrey said before a studio audience of sexual abuse survivors. It is much bigger than any one person. This is a moment in time that allows us to see this societal corruption. It's like a scourge on humanity. If it gets you, our audience, to see how it happens, then some good would have come of it.Indeed, the world has changed since Winfrey left daytime, but there is still good that could come from the new conversations she could have back in front of a broad audience. The question Wilder poses, however: Has the way in which people engage with each other shifted to a point where that Oprah magic wouldn't necessarily work today? When The Oprah Winfrey Show went off the air, it was one year before Facebook became a publicly traded company, Instagram was only a year old, and Netflix wouldn't release it's first original content series, House of Cards, until two years later.I just think the way in which we engage is very, very different, she says. As long as she's around her voice is going to command something quite viable, but I wonder the extent to which the medium would continue to thrive. And with whom it would thrive, as communication styles have evolved, Wilder adds.  I do think that another important question to raise is the extent to which Oprah's brand, if you will, connects with younger generations, particularly younger generations of women of color, she says.Some have taken the Oprah baton and run with it. Red Table Talk, a Facebook chat show hosted by Jada Pinkett Smith, Willow Smith, and Adrienne Banfield-Norris, is both multi-gen and next-gen. It features three generations of women tackling issues like motherhood and drug addiction. The roughly 20-minute episodes are at times emotional, always thoughtful and wildly popular. One recent episode, an interview with gossip figure Jordyn Woods, racked up more than 30 million views in just a little more than two weeks. Oprah Winfrey Show veteran Ellen Rakieten is among the show's executive producers. To be clear, Oprah's discussions about important issues have not ceased since her talk show went off the air. As a 60 Minutes contributor, on her SuperSoul Conversations series, or thestage at the Golden Globes, she's not stopped talking about what's important to her. Nor are there indications she will be any time soon.Winfrey and Apple entered into a multi-year content agreement last year but no details have been announced since. With the tech company set to make some major announcements about its video programming at a March 25 event in Cupertino, California, it stands to reason specifics on Winfrey's plans with Apple could be among them.I think the country is benefiting from having Oprah in the position that she's in right now, Wilder says, positively. I think she's been able to do a number of things with the OWN network in the way she's provided spaces and platforms for other change-makers and other change-agents...other people who wouldn't necessarily have a seat at the table or have any type of heavy influence. The ideal, Wilder says, would be to have not just  Oprah or another Oprah to lead the next generation, but many. People who can give voice to the voiceless, people who can allow us to comfortably push back. People who can convene us, connect us and inspire us. People who can push us to be critical, she says. I think there's tons of women, particularly women of color, who are doing that on smaller scales that need to continue to do that. In that, Wilder is right. Having more platforms has positively led to more elevated voices. But as viewers have found corners of the content landscape to feel seen and heard, what's arguably still missing is what The Oprah Winfrey Show was for 25 seasons: a place where we feel challenged to see and hear others.

{"title": "'The Act' spins deadly mother-daughter story into Hulu series", "cate": "entertainment", "content": "The Act offers the  of the ill-fated relationship between Dee Dee and Gypsy Rose Blanchard in two months, and it's easily the better of the two. Yet while this Hulu limited series captures the unsettling con game played by the mother, be forewarned that replicating these events can be as off-putting as the actual characters.The story of the Blanchards -- which ended with Dee Dee's murder, leading to the convictions of Gypsy Rose and her boyfriend -- has already been told, quite well, in the  Mommy Dead and Dearest.Based on a Buzzfeed article by Michelle Dean, who adapted the series with Nick Antosca, The Act has the latitude to tease that out over eight episodes, casting Patricia Arquette -- fresh off her standout turn in Escape at Dannemora -- as Dee Dee and Joey King as the pipsqueak-voiced Gypsy.For those unfamiliar, Dee Dee kept Gypsy in a perpetual child-like state, while convincing the girl that she suffered from an array of maladies with which she wasn't actually afflicted, a form of abuse by a caregiver known as Munchausen syndrome by proxy. Here, that includes jabbing her with an epi-pen every time her daughter comes into contact with sugar, even though it's later revealed that isn't actually allergic.The story unfolds partly through the eyes of a neighbor, Mel (Chloe Sevigny), who is initially skeptical when the Blanchards and their sob stories take up residence across the street, as well as said neighbor's daughter (AnnaSophia Robb), who becomes a sort of confidant for Gypsy. The murder, meanwhile, is presented in glimpses, letting the narrative play as a flashback from the body being discovered.Anyone who has seen footage of the Blanchards understands how stilted their behavior was, qualities that the actresses have dutifully captured. I can dress up in my princess dress and make friends! Gypsy squeals in a high-pitched voice at one point, before her view of her mom begins to seriously sour.As for Arquette, she conveys the martyr-like qualities that Dee Dee projected in her efforts to wring money and gifts from the situation, but does so using a honeyed, breathless voice. It's a bit like being subjected to an adult speaking baby-talk, a cross between Blanche DuBois and Kate McKinnon impersonating Jeff Sessions on Saturday Night Live.The Act remains oddly fascinating, perhaps especially so as the strange, sad relationship between the needy Gypsy and disturbed Nick (Calum Worthy) develops. That said, given the cloying nature of Dee Dee's persona, watching does begin to feel like a bit of an ordeal.Hulu is already positioning The Act as an umbrella title that the streaming service intends to re-use to dramatize other high-profile crimes, chronicling self-contained stories over each subsequent season. It is, in essence, a vehicle for turning what would otherwise become Lifetime movies or episodes of Dateline NBC into miniseries.The network and producers will have a hard time finding another yarn as inherently creepy as this one, and not every salacious murder can bear the weight of such multipart productions; still, as we've seen time and again with TV's current true-crime wave, that won't prevent them from trying."},

I really didn't like the focus of the whole show coming onto Jon -- even though it was invalidating my problem about being the weak link because things were about Jon.Harington's character on the HBO fantasy series was killed in the Season 5 finale, but brought back. (HBO and CNN share the same parent company).Viewer reaction to the plot twist was intense. When you become the cliffhanger of a TV show, and a TV show probably at the height of its power, the focus on you is f\u2014ing terrifying, Harington said. The actor told Variety that when it was all happening, It wasn't a very good time in my life.I felt I had to feel that I was the most fortunate person in the world, when actually, I felt very vulnerable, he said. I had a shaky time in my life around there -- like I think a lot of people do in their 20s.Harington said it led him to seek help. That was a time when I started therapy, and started talking to people, he said. I had felt very unsafe, and I wasn't talking to anyone. I had to feel very grateful for what I have, but I felt incredibly concerned about whether I could even f\u2014ing act.Harington likened the experience to when you're at a party, and the party's getting better and better. Then you reach this point of the party where you're like, it's peaked.I don't know what I could find more from this. You realize, well, there isn't more, Harington said. This is it. And the 'more' that you can find is actually in the work rather than the enjoyment surrounding it.The eighth and final season of Game of Thrones premieres April 14. "},
{"title": "'Action' and 'Screwball' pitch darker side of sports madness", "cate": "entertainment", "content": "The NCAA basketball tournament leading into the new baseball season is arguably among the best few weeks on the sports calendar. But the kickoff to March Madness and opening day also coincide with three documentaries highlighting different aspects of sports' darker side, especially in its impact beyond the court and field.Given the amount of office pools built around the tournament, Showtime might have the most timely entry with Action, a series about the world of sports gambling, focusing primarily on money wagered on pro football. While showcasing the colorful characters who participate -- and the pained or exultant faces in casino sports books -- the four-part show also delves into the destructive nature of compulsive gambling. Hitting theaters before Major League Baseball begins, meanwhile, is Screwball, director Billy Corben's look at the use of performance-enhancing drugs, zeroing in on the 2014 scandal -- almost comical in its details and scope -- that swept up a number of players, including the year-long suspension of then-Yankees star Alex Rodriguez.Finally, there's Roll Red Roll, a limited release that examines what came to be known as rape culture in the story of an inebriated teenage girl who was sexually assaulted by members of the high-school football team in Steubenville, Ohio in 2012.Steubenville became a national story, prompting soul-searching about the manner in which the accusations were handled. As Rachel Dissell, a reporter for the Cleveland Plain Dealer, puts it in the documentary, Is this football town putting its daughters at risk by protecting its sons in a situation like this? Some of the most disturbing material in Roll Red Roll comes via audio from a sports radio show, where the host sounds determined to support the players, speculating that it was easier for the girl to tell your parents you were raped than admit to getting drunk and having sex. There are also accusations, denied by authorities, that police slow-walked the case, and that school administrators deferred to the football coach, who in an interview with police appears to have accepted the word of his players.Screwball, by contrast, brings a lighter touch and almost satirical approach to what's been described as the biggest illegal steroid scheme in pro sports history.The operation involved Biogenesis founder Tony Bosch and a slew of over-the-top characters who made a mockery of baseball's crackdown on performance-enhancing drugs, says Tim Elfrink, co-author of the book Blood Sport: A-Rod and the Quest to End Baseball's Steroid Era.Having served more than 18 months in federal custody for his role, Bosch is an exceptionally good interview, recalling how he could watch baseball on TV and witness the fruits of his work. It was almost like, 'Hey mom, I made it to the big leagues, but in a different way,' he says.Action uses as its jumping-off point a 2018  that cleared the way for states to legalize sports betting, and the repercussions for those who have already built lives and careers around gambling on games.Most express concern about the longterm impact of the court decision, with professional gambler Bill Krack Krackomberger warning that legalized betting will bring snake-oil salesmen and charlatans coming out of the woodwork, a point underscored by radio and TV ads for can't-miss handicappers.CBS' 60 Minutes will also address the issue of legalized gambling in its March 24 episode, with one athletic director sounding alarms that the changes -- and money swirling around games -- will turn into a source of temptation for college athletes.It's not unusual, of course, to hear those who savor sports as an enjoyable escape from their daily cares lament such coverage. But as each of these projects reinforces in one way or another, sports are also a business, one whose toxic elements and deeper relationship to society can't -- or at least shouldn't -- be swept under the bleachers."},

Smollett has denied he was involved in orchestrating the attack, and is currently free on bail. Mark Geragos, one of Smollett's attorneys and a CNN legal analyst, said the actor maintains his innocence and called the indictment prosecutorial overkill.This redundant and vindictive indictment is nothing more than a desperate attempt to make headlines, Geragos said.In January Smollett reported to police that he had been attacked in an incident that included a noose being placed around his neck. Police initially investigated it as a possible hate crime.Daniels posted a video on Instagram Wednesday prior to the airing of Empire and the other Fox series he also created, Star.While he didn't mention Smollett by name in the video, Daniels wrote in the caption I was so in my feelings last week that I forgot to post about @empirefox & @staronfox .... I guess y'all know why...anyway I'm back and I'm finally ok!!!!These past couple of weeks have been a freakin' roller coaster, Daniels said in the video.

To be called 'die f****t,' 'n****r' or whatever they said to you. You are better than that. We are better than that. America is better than that.Daniels was one of the producers who released a statement last month that Smollett had been cut from the final two episodes of the current season.The events of the past few weeks have been incredibly emotional for all of us, the statement said.

{"title": "'Us' delivers thrills, but it's no 'Get Out'", "cate": "entertainment", "content": "Us is a solid, almost old-fashioned thriller. What it isn't, notably, is a movie that matches the sky-high expectations raised by writer-director 's first film, , wildly enthusiastic and its slick marketing campaign.Peele has been victimized to some extent by his own success, and the way Get Out deftly tapped into the cultural moment while weaving in laughs amid the thrills. Nevertheless, this second effort works well enough to entertain date-night audiences while offering a reminder that these kind of movies are tough to consistently pull off.The best and worst thing that Us has going for it hinges on the apparent simplicity of the concept. A family of four goes on vacation to the seaside town where the mother, Adelaide (Lupita Nyong'o, making the most of her dual role), experienced a childhood trauma, the memory of which remains dim.In the movie's most arresting moment, Adelaide, her husband (Black Panther's Winston Duke) and their two kids (Shahadi Wright Joseph, Evan Alex) look out the window and see four figures silhouetted in the driveway. As the shapes come into focus, the boy observes that the people outside look like, well, us.From there, Peele deftly builds tension, drawing on the rich tradition of movies like Invasion of the Body Snatchers along with the genre of There's something in the house! horror films upon which Get Out also capitalized.Why are they doing this? the boy asks, at roughly the time when the audience is surely wondering the same thing.As the narrative progresses, though, there's a nagging sense that the payoff might not be the equal of the jump-out-at-you thrills, a concern borne out, largely, by the movie's last act.Peele, it's worth noting, is about to launch a new version of The Twilight Zone on CBS All Access, and the specter of that series looms over Us in the way it has many a movie in the years since. Once you set up an inexplicable scenario, there are the twin challenges of both sustaining the suspense and delivering an explanation rooted in logic as well as surprise.Us does fine on the former front, but falls short on the latter. While there are hints at bigger ideas within the plot, the structure isn't nearly as elegant as what, yes, Get Out economically captured.Having set the bar so high, Peele can be forgiven for the disparity. Yet that's the inevitable burden of early success, in much the way that the descending quality of M. Night Shyamalan's movies couldn't help referencing The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable.If advance box-office projections prove accurate, Us is headed toward a strong opening, which should cement its director's status as the new toast of Hollywood.As a first film, this movie would have surely been hailed for its promise. Held up against a debut that garnered a well-deserved Oscar nomination and honors for best original screenplay, it's easy to come way thinking that Us doesn't merit all that fuss."},

I tried to ignore the pain and push through it, but I just couldn't. I told my trainer I had to take a break. Somehow, almost crawling, I made it to the locker room. I reached the toilet, sank to my knees, and proceeded to be violently, voluminously ill. Meanwhile, the pain shooting, stabbing, constricting pain was getting worse.

{"title": "Jordan Peele and the art of being unapologetically black ", "cate": "entertainment", "content": "Call it revenge of the blerds.Jordan Peele, a self-proclaimed black nerd who helped to popularize the term as part of the comedy duo Key and Peele, is boldly going where no black man has gone before by conquering the horror film genre.His sophomore film, Us, is out Friday to rave reviews and early awards season buzz for its star, Lupita Nyong'o.'The film is on track to make history as the biggest horror film about a black family, written and directed by a black man with a mostly black cast. Peele is among several successful creatives in Hollywood who are being unapologetically black in their craft.Along with Peele, Atlanta's Donald Glover, Insecure's Issa Rae, Black-ish creator Kenya Barris, Luke Cage showrunner Cheo Hodari Coker and filmmakers Ava DuVernay and Ryan Coogler have produced entertainment that showcases the African-American experience as part of the American experience as a whole, while still celebrating the uniqueness of black culture. Collectively, they have produced content in which they don't feel the need to give context for mainstream America. If you don't get a joke or a reference because it's too inside black baseball as it were, there's always Google.They are also reminders of what should be a given but isn't in a society fractured by debates over race and class: people of color have smart, funny, engaging and relatable stories to tell. When Peele used the '90s rap song I Got 5 On It by Luniz in his film and trailer, it sparked about the brilliance of transforming a classic hip-hop track into a menacing horror soundtrack.It was black and it was beautiful. , That song, it came pretty simple.I'm making a movie in Northern California, that's a Bay Area hip-hop classic and I wanted to explore this very relatable journey of being a parent [and] maybe some of the songs you listened to back in the day aren't appropriate for your kids, he said. So that was one level, and another part was, I love songs that have a great feeling but also have a haunting element to them and I feel like the beat in that song has this inherent cryptic energy, almost reminiscent of the 'Nightmare on Elm Street' soundtrack.Those were the ideas that that song hit the bullseye on for me, and also, it's just a dope track, he added.Momentum for moments like that has been building since the embracing of blerds. The rise of black nerds was thrust into the spotlight in 2012 by NPR television critic, Eric Deggans. For years, we black nerds felt caught between white folks' expectations that we'd be cooler and black folks' disappointment that we're clearly not, said Deggans, who is also the author of Race-Baiter: How the Media Wields Dangerous Words to Divide a Nation and was at the time the TV and media critic for the Tampa Bay Times. But then, something wonderful happened that turned the image of the black nerd sideways.That something, according to Deggans, was the success of argyle sweater wearing rapper Kanye West.Look around now and blerds are everywhere, intellectual, rock and roll loving, politics talking, comic book reading black nerds, Deggans said.Blerds are a tribe that has endured the, You aren't like other black people wonderment and the surprised, You are into THAT? remarks with a polite smile to the face and an eye roll as soon as they turn away. The blerd culture is very similar to what it's like to be black in Hollywood, where being labeled as the other can work both for and against you. Not only is there the ever looming specter of the lack of diversity (hello #OscarsSoWhite), but black people in Hollywood are almost always held up as representatives of their culture.If a movie by a black director or starring a majority black cast is successful, invariably there are think pieces published either speculating on or declaring that it's the beginning of a golden era for black films. Let it flop and the conversation pivots to whether it will now become more difficult to get similar projects made in the future.Us on its own is an already critically acclaimed horror film, predicted to scare up major box office receipts. And while it is not explicitly about race, like Peele's first film, Get Out, there are layers of identity themes in Us, which centers on a black family and their murderous doppelgangers.It's the kind of film that needs to be viewed more than once to peel back all that Peele appears to be saying about who we are as a nation. In Peele said his hope was to make horror films in the vein of two of his favorites, Rosemary's Baby and The Stepford Wives.  I consider them social thrillers, he said at the time. They're about gender and the women's lib movement and that civil rights movement, but they're also entertaining mysteries. I figured we could make a 'Rosemary's Baby/Stepford Wives' of race.With Get Out and Us, he is well on his way.  "},

{"title": "She was dancing on the roof and talking gibberish. A special kind of ER helped her", "cate": "health", "content": "For decades, hospitals have strained to accommodate patients in psychiatric crisis in emergency rooms. The horror stories of failure abound:Patients heavily sedated or shackled to gurneys for days while awaiting placement in a specialized psychiatric hospital, their symptoms exacerbated by the noise and chaos of emergency medicine. Long wait times in crowded ERs for people who show up with serious medical emergencies. High costs for taxpayers, insurers and families as patients languish longer than necessary in the most expensive place to get care.If you are living with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, that is a really tough way to begin that road to recovery, said Dr. Jack Rozel, president of the American Association for Emergency Psychiatry.In pockets across the country, hospitals are trying something new to address the unique needs of psychiatric patients: opening emergency units specifically designed to help stabilize and treat patients and connect them to longer-term resources and care. These psychiatric ERs aim to address the growing number of patients with mental health conditions who end up hospitalized because traditional emergency rooms don't have the time or expertise to treat the crisis.The rate of ER visits involving psychoses, bipolar disorder, depression or anxiety  from 2006 to 2013, according to the federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. Roughly 1 in 8 emergency department visits now stem from mental illness or substance use disorders, the data show. The psychiatric ERs, staffed with nurses, social workers and psychiatrists, work to treat and release patients in under 24 hours, much as traditional emergency rooms handle physical ailments. Those who are well enough to go home get discharged, while those who need more treatment are admitted to the hospital or transferred to an inpatient facility.There are now roughly 100 such units across the country, said Dr. Scott Zeller, vice president of acute psychiatry at Vituity, a physician-led organization that provides staffing and consulting services to medical centers nationwide. Zeller pioneered the approach while working as chief of psychiatric emergency services at John George Psychiatric Hospital in Alameda County, Calif. Over time, he transformed the center from a traditional ward where restraints were common into one that treated patients in a more supportive, living-room like setting. The results \u2014 in terms of both patient outcomes and cost-savings \u2014 made Zeller a believer. He is helping design , including in California, Florida, Illinois and Tennessee. Each is distinct, accepting patients in somewhat different circumstances and offering a slightly different range of services. Patients who arrive at an emergency room for psychiatric or substance use disorders are more than twice as likely to be admitted than other patients, federal data show. And yet about 80 percent of the time, Zeller said, patients' mental health crises can be resolved without a costly inpatient hospital stay. A patient may be having a psychotic episode because he fell off his medications, for example, or having drug-induced hallucinations. We need to treat people at the emergency level of care, he said. The vast majority of psychiatric emergencies can be resolved in less than 24 hours. Wearing a hospital gown, Rachel Diamond lay back in her recliner in a spacious room in a relatively new ward at Providence Little Company of Mary Medical Center San Pedro, a hospital near the Port of Los Angeles. Nearby, a few patients slept on identical recliners, draped in soft blankets. Others communed at a kitchen table over microwaved meals. A nurse walked through the locked unit with a rolling cart, dispensing medications.Except for a nursing station in the middle of the room, the unit didn't look much like a health care facility. The room was divided into men's and women's sides, with separate TVs. A few smaller rooms \u2014 where patients could meet with a psychiatrist or social worker \u2014 lined the unit's edge. Anya Price, interim clinical supervisor and a nurse, said the unit was designed to feel more like a home than a hospital. We're operating from an understanding that they're coming here to get better, Price said.The open design of the unit, known as the Outpatient Behavioral Health Center, allows patients to move freely. Staff said it also helps reduce problems because they can quickly spot a patient who may be getting agitated. Dr. Herbert Harman, a psychiatrist and medical director for the facility, said violence and the need for restraints are rare.The unit is in a building a short walk from the medical center emergency room. It opened in 2017 and accepts patients from emergency rooms across Los Angeles County once they are deemed stable medically. So far this year, its staff has treated about 400 patients, Price said. One recent morning, the patients included a man in his 40s found on the railroad tracks after an alcohol binge, and a woman with a history of schizophrenia who said she was seeing spirits. Some were there on involuntary holds because authorities had decided they were at risk of hurting themselves or others because of their illness. Diamond, 30, said she has been diagnosed with depression and anxiety and has landed in multiple ERs over the past decade when her symptoms spiked out of control. During those stays, she said, she often felt isolated and in the dark about her treatment. Doctors typically numbed her with medications and consigned her to a guarded room. No one really talked to me, said Diamond, who lives in Torrance, Calif. It was like I was a caged animal. She had been living in a car and fighting with her boyfriend in late February when she decided she wanted to end her life. She tried jumping out of a moving car, and when that didn't work, she grabbed a bottle of pills. She gets help for her mental health issues, but sometimes, she said, the stress becomes too much. This time, she was taken to a hospital emergency room in Torrance before being transferred to the San Pedro unit. During her time in the behavioral health center \u2014 about 26 hours \u2014 she slept, received medications and met with nurses, a social worker and a psychiatrist. She said it was calmer than a regular ER, and the staff had time to talk, listen and help her through the worst of the crisis. I genuinely feel better enough to leave, she said. I haven't been able to say that in a while.Zeller argues that the use of emergency psychiatric clinics is both humane and cost-effective.  on the Alameda County model found such units can dramatically reduce how long patients spend in medical emergency rooms, and that about three-quarters of patients treated in the units can be discharged to the community rather than to inpatient care. That, Zeller said, can lessen the overwhelming demand for inpatient psychiatric beds and preserve available spots for those who truly require them. The model saves money for hospitals in part because the patients spend less time in emergency care. The return on investment is exponential, he said. In Montana, the Billings Clinic opened a psychiatric stabilization unit last April across the street from the traditional ER. Dr. Eric Arzubi, psychiatry department chair, said nearly 10 percent of the visits in the Billings Clinic emergency room involve people in psychiatric crisis. Since the new unit opened, wait times for psychiatric patients have dropped from about 10 hours to four hours, and fewer patients are being admitted to the inpatient unit. Arzubi said his staff isn't trying to cure people of their mental illness but rather stabilize them and get them the care they need.Just like in the emergency room, you don't get comprehensive care, Arzubi said. But you can stop the bleeding, you stabilize the patient and get them to the right level of care.In some cases, that means a transfer to an inpatient facility. Staff at the San Pedro unit decided soon after Chantelle Unique arrived that she would be one of those patients. Unique, who is 23, has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. She had been dancing on the roof and speaking gibberish when her mother called 911. Unique said she has had a hard time in regular emergency rooms. There are a million people, she said. For most of a morning at the San Pedro facility, she sat calmly watching TV, talking to nurses and eating spaghetti. But at one point, she started pacing and yelling at other patients. Nurses and security guards quickly surrounded her and persuaded her to return to her recliner and take additional medication.Finding an inpatient bed for a patient like Unique with more progressed mental illness is not always easy, said clinical social worker Mark Tawfik. But he's committed to finding a way. We have to make sure we find them adequate resources, he said. Otherwise, they will come right back.For Price, the clinical supervisor, even when a patient requires a transfer for more intensive care, there's satisfaction in knowing that person is headed in the right direction. If Unique hadn't been brought in, Price said, she would have been out in the community, lost to her delusions, putting herself at risk of accident or arrest.In the unit, staff made sure she was safe, Price said, in addition to providing a warm bed, some food and some compassion.

It's not clear when that issue will next be addressed, but a hearing in the overall case is next scheduled for May 7.Kelly's legal team had filed a motion Wednesday, asking the court to grant him permission to travel next month to Dubai to perform shows -- arguing that Kelly needs to work to pay child support and other bills. The singer had surrendered his passport under terms of the bail he was granted in February.  But Greenberg told reporters Friday after the hearing that he wanted to amend the request with additional information. He didn't specify what he'd add.I think there were some more details to be filled in to give the judge a certain comfort level that might make him more likely to rule in Kelly's favor, Greenberg said.Wednesday's court filing had stressed Kelly's need to generate income, as he has struggled of late to pay his child support and other child related expenses, and has fallen behind on his studio rent.It also says Kelly has recently had difficulty working in the United States, citing two performances or appearances that organizers have canceled in the past year.But on Friday, Kelly's entertainment attorney Doug Anton said offers recently have come in for Kelly to perform just about everywhere you could imagine.Greenberg said it wasn't clear yet whether they could amend their request in time for Kelly's scheduled performances in April in Dubai.He may still go to Dubai. He may not go to Dubai. We'll see, Greenberg said.Kelly, 52,  faces involving four alleged victims, including three who prosecutors say were underage girls. The  charges cover allegations from 1998 to 2010.He has pleaded not guilty to the charges and has consistently denied allegations of abusing women or being sexually involved with underage girls.The charges, filed last month, come after  of Kelly being associated with accusations of abuse, manipulation and inappropriate encounters with girls and young women. He has strongly denied the accusations and has not been convicted in any criminal case connected to them.In the latest case, two of the victims were 16 years old at the time of the alleged abuse, one was between 14 and 16, and the fourth was 24, according to Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx's description of the evidence. The indictment says Kelly used force or the threat of force.The charges were , after attorney Michael Avenatti announced he had given the state's attorney's office a videotape that he said showed Kelly having sex with an underage girl.CNN has seen the VHS tape, which is 42 minutes and 45 seconds, clear and explicit. It appears to show Kelly having sex with a girl who refers to her body parts as 14 years old.In a February 23 hearing, prosecutors revealed graphic details, including accusations that Kelly spit on two victims. And one of the alleged victims provided authorities with a shirt she wore during an alleged encounter with Kelly, which later tested positive for his DNA, prosecutors said.Kelly was jailed February 22 in the current case before being released on bail three days later.Greenberg has said he has not seen the tape and has demanded that prosecutors share it. He also  he believes the accusers are lying and Kelly would be vindicated.On Friday, the judge said that before the state turns over the tape, a court order would have to be put in place to ensure the video -- because it's alleged to show underage sex -- is protected. The judge did not address when or how that would happen.What is on the video mirrors some of the alleged acts for which Kelly was arrested in a child pornography case in 2002, when he was 35.In that 2002 case, there also was a video in which prosecutors said he appeared to be having sex with a girl.Kelly was .Greenberg has  one of the current charges appears to involve the same alleged victim from the earlier case, and double jeopardy should bar that case.But the charges in the earlier case were child pornography charges -- different from the aggravated sexual abuse charges Kelly currently faces.Kelly has been sued by multiple women accusing him of having sex with them when they were underage. Most cases, with the exception of the trial at which he was acquitted, have been settled out of court.There has been a growing movement against him, including the #MuteRKelly campaign to stop his music from being played. His hits include I Believe I Can Fly and Ignition.In January, the release of the docuseries, Surviving R. Kelly, on Lifetime television helped boost the public campaign against him.In that series, women said they were kept in abusive sexual relationships.Kelly this month in a nearly 80-minute interview told CBS News' Gayle King he denied holding women against their will or having sex with anyone younger than 17.I have been assassinated, Kelly said, asserting he was a victim of lies. I have been buried alive, but I'm alive.Kelly also was  involving what authorities said was failure to pay his ex-wife child support of $160,000. He was also released in that case after posting bail.CNN's Bill Kirkos, Lisa Respers France, Sara Sidner, Steve Almasy and Dakin Andone contributed to this report."},

The only exceptions would be to prevent a woman's death or her serious risk of impairment.The heartbeat has been the universal hallmark of life since man's very beginning, Bryant said in an address before signing the bill. I can remember the exciting moments both with my children and grandchildren when the first sonograms were taken and that heartbeat could be heard.But that celebration is often turned into tragedy when the child's life is taken, he continued.

And today, Senate Bill 2116 begins that at the earliest possible opportunity. Numerous states across the nation have floated similar bills; right now lawmakers in Ohio, Tennessee and Georgia are trying to pass them. But just as often as they get introduced, they get shut down. They are held up in committees, rejected in legislative votes, vetoed by governors and struck down in courts. Not one state has managed to put a heartbeat bill, as they're often referred to, into lasting practice. And yet they .Earlier this week, a judge stopped Kentucky's version of the heartbeat bill from becoming law.

A judge struck down the state's 15-week ban just months ago, but lawmakers didn't get the message. They are determined to rob Mississippians of the right to abortion, and they are doing it at the expense of women's health and taxpayer money. This ban -- just like the 15 week ban the Governor signed a year ago -- is cruel and clearly unconstitutional. "},

However, in the present circumstances we do not think it right to seek or accept further donations from the Sacklers, Tate said in a statement.In a statement issued to CNN, a spokesperson for the Mortimer and Raymond Sackler family, the branch of the family dealing with the Tate group, said: We deeply sympathize with all the communities, families and individuals affected by the addiction crisis in America.

{"title": "As mumps outbreak grows at Temple University, there's a 'strong recommendation' for vaccine", "cate": "health", "content": "Temple University in Philadelphia has reported 74 cases of mumps in an outbreak that began last month, according to a  sent to the university community on Thursday. Mark Denys, director of student and employee health services, said 15 of those cases are confirmed and 59 are probable. Forty-six of those cases have been identified in the last eight days. The university said it is working with the local health department to contain the outbreak. Mumps is a vaccine-preventable disease that is caused by a virus. It is spread through saliva or mucus by coughing, sneezing or talking or sharing eating utensils or cups, according to the CDC. It can also spread when an infected person touches items or surfaces that are then touched by someone else who picks up the virus.Outbreaks usually occur among people who have close contact, such as on college campuses and among sports teams.Symptoms can appear 12 to 25 days after a person is infected and can include fever, headache, muscle aches, being tired and loss of appetite. The hallmark, though, is swollen glands under the ears that are tender. But not everyone has symptoms, especially if they are experiencing a mild case of the illness.One of the most important steps you can take if you experience symptoms is to self-isolate, avoid travel and limit contact with others for five days from the onset of symptoms, the notification said. Denys also reminded people to cover their mouths when coughing, wash hands frequently, and avoid sharing food and drink.   The best way to prevent mumps is with a vaccine. According to the CDC, the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine is 88% effective when two doses are given.The university advises anyone who has not received two doses of the vaccine and a booster to get vaccinated now. This is not required, but is a strong recommendation, Ray Betzner, associate vice president for strategic marketing and communications at Temple, said in an email. We are encouraging those who have had the two MMR vaccines to get the booster.According to a fact sheet from the City of Philadelphia Department of Public Health, A third dose can boost protection during an outbreak and help stop the virus from spreading. There will be two free vaccination clinics at the university next week for students, faculty and staff.Dissatisfied with the response by the university, a group of students filed a petition on change.org to temporarily close the university to stop the outbreak, saying, It is time that Temple takes the necessary action to halt the outbreak before this epidemic becomes unmanageable. The petition, which has more than 10,000 signatures so far, says the outbreak makes the university an unsafe environment for all students and faculty and that this is especially true for those with autoimmune diseases. The fact is, as long as Temple continues to stay open, and classes and activities continue to be held, this outbreak will not cease. As of Friday afternoon the change.org petition was no longer available on the site.We are not discussing closing due to mumps, Betzner said. The Philadelphia Health Department does not recommend closing the university [as] it will not stop the ongoing spread of mumps. He said infectious disease experts, and other universities who have had mumps outbreaks, agree. Denys said the university is taking steps to update its immunization policy to require two doses of MMR vaccine; two doses of the chickenpox vaccine; and one dose of tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis vaccine, known as Tdap.As of February 28, 151 cases of mumps have been reported in the United States this year, according to the . In 2018, more than 2,000 cases were reported. Correction: A previous version of this story incorrectly described the recommendation for a booster dose of the MMR vaccine. "},
{"title": "How to know whether you're a 'helicopter parent' and why it matters ", "cate": "health", "content": "The fear of being a helicopter parent began years before I had my first son. Back then, I was fairly certain I could avoid overparenting, and would give my children a healthy amount of freedom.Now, seven years and two kids later, I have no idea if that's the case. If I get down on the floor to do blocks with my toddler, am I guiding or hovering? If I help my kindergartner with a school project, am I inspiring or overbearing?While helicopter parent was first identified decades ago, the concerns surrounding it have evolved. First, we largely worried about the effect this style of parenting had on kids, who were being raised in a pressure cooker and suffering anxiety and depression as a result. Then we became worried about the effect it had on parents, particularly working moms who couldn't keep up with the relentless demands at home after a day in the office. Now we are contemplating the way helicopter parenting feeds the growing gap between the rich and the poor. In their new book , economists Matthias Doepke and Fabrizio Zilibotti look at how parents in more unequal societies, like the United States, tend to push their children harder than those in more equal societies, like Sweden. The more we perceive the world as one in which the winner-takes-all, the more we are likely to do whatever we can to ensure that our children are the winners.My hand-wringing over possibly being a helicopter parent takes into account all three of these issues, along with one more complicating factor. Research shows that some degree of hands-on parenting can actually be beneficial for children, helping them emotionally and cognitively. My own life also tells me that some degree of hands-on parenting can be fulfilling for the parents too. I'm not pining for the days of benign neglect, but I also don't want be buying my children's toilet paper for them while they are in college -- a college they got into with the help of the thousands of dollars I spent on tutoring, .How do we know how much parenting is the right amount? And how can I figure out if that is the amount I am doing? Or, in other words, am I a helicopter parent?One reason I am so confused about whether or not I am a helicopter parent is because the definition of it is unclear. Helicopter parenting is often used as a synonym for intensive parenting, and, more confusingly, both permissive and authoritarian parenting. But these are all different.Intensive parenting means you put a lot of time, energy and thought into raising your children. Helicopter parenting means you oversteer and overprotect, leaving little up to chance. Helicopter parents can come in all flavors. There are the buttoned-up ones, who have their sights set on Ivy League degrees, and free-spirited ones, who view the curation of their child's creativity and self-expression as a monumental task.Permissive and authoritarian parenting is part of another taxonomy altogether, one that also includes authoritative parenting. Authoritarian means you lead by command without taking the child's desires into consideration; authoritative means you direct your children, but are also responsive and nurturing; and permissive means you let your children do whatever they want.One can be permissive or authoritarian and still be a helicopter parent. Permissive helicopter parents ensure that their child gets what their child wants. Authoritarian helicopter parents ensure that their child gets what the parent wants. Either way, the child has few opportunities to fend for herself.Helicopter parents don't develop independence and self-advocacy in their children, said Catherine Steiner-Adair, clinical psychologist, school consultant and co-author of .  Self-evaluation is always a risky endeavor, but here it goes. I give my kids a decent amount of free time, allow them to experience failure, and don't force them to take up a hobby unless they're interested. However, when they are interested in something I encourage it, engage with them about it, and make them stick with it. I'd say I am an authoritative and non-helicopter parent, while quite possibly an intensive parent. But as to whether this is a bad thing, requires me to understand when and how intensive becomes too intense.Karen Zilberstein, a psychotherapist and author of , thinks some of the guilt around intensive parenting today is misguided. Right now the culture is asking us to raise skilled kids in a culture that is more complicated than it was in the past, she said. For most of history, she explained, childhood was much shorter. It was reasonable to believe that a person could gain all the skills they needed to succeed in life by age 13. But now childhood lasts much longer, some say throughout our early 20s, in part because people today have a lot more to learn about how to make it on their own than their counterparts in the past.This makes the fact that we coach our children more than our parents coached us a little bit inevitable, and, in many ways, desirable. Perhaps we should focus less on how much time we spend engaging with our children, and more on the quality of that engagement. Steiner-Adair said the trick -- and it's not always easy -- is to listen to your kids, early and often. Try to understand who they are, what they want, and then help them try to achieve it.When parents have a narrow definition of success, when they think their job of being a parent is to chart a path, with low risk, to the door of their definition of success, that is the problem, said Steiner-Adair. The last thing you want is a child to feel that who they are isn't good enough and what they love doesn't matter to you.I suspect a line can be drawn between parents' inability to meet their kids where their kids are at, and the widely shared feeling that parenting today is relentless. There's no question that parents today are overtaxed, in part due to unforgiving workplaces and a . Though for some of us, particularly middle and upper-income families, at least some of the burden of parenting could be relieved by lowering our expectations for our children and allowing them to lead.Ultimately, the most pernicious effect of all this hand-wringing over helicopter parenting is the way it turns our gazes inward. We think a lot about ourselves as individuals, whether we are doing too much, and what we can do better. This heightened concern rarely spills over to thinking about others, people we could help, or with whom we could make life better for ourselves and our children. Zilberstein encourages upper- and middle-class parents to think less about whether or not they are giving their children an advantage, and more about the ways they can help share those advantages with other children. This might involve offering to help drive another child to music class whose parents don't have the means or ability to get their child there, or to get involved locally with an organization that works with low-income families. Also, supporting universal, and high-quality, childcare, preschool and after-school programs is a great way to try to level the playing field.For those who feel like they are overdoing it with their kids but don't know how to stop: This is not a problem most of us can fix on our own. Our homes may feel like private places, but the energy and ideals within them often come from the world outside our doors.If you live in a culture that says you can't let your kids get off the bus without an adult there to take him home, or we'll arrest you for letting your kids walk home from the park, how can you do anything other than spend more time with them than you otherwise care to? said Lenore Skenazy, founder of the Free-Range Kids movement and president of , a new non-profit promoting childhood independence and resilience.Let Grow has a number of useful suggestions to give our children more freedom. They recommend that schools keep gyms and playgrounds open after-school, for mixed-age free-play. Also, parents and schools should team up and encourage children to pick activities they feel ready to do on their own, like walking the dog or making dinner, and then give it a shot. One thing to remember is that none of us are purely anything. People think I am anti-helicopter parenting, but what I am really against is a culture that has made us so scared about everything, like our kids falling behind or getting hurt, Skenazy said. Forget worrying about what kind of parent you are, she explained, and instead ask yourself: Are there things in my culture or community or block or school or house that are making me and my child miserable that I can change? Things that I find too onerous and unnecessary?The first thing I'd change is my habit of processing my parenting through trendy, social science catchphrases and click-bait opeds. Am I a helicopter parent? An intensive parent? Who knows. As long as my kids feel heard, have space to make their own choices, and I'm doing what I can to help make sure other children feel the same, we're good.

{"title": "Hundreds of cities, counties and Native American tribes file federal lawsuit against Sackler family over opioid crisis", "cate": "health", "content": "More than 600 cities, counties and Native American tribes from 28 states have filed a federal lawsuit against eight members of the Sackler family -- owners of the pharmaceutical giant Purdue Pharma LP -- accusing them of creating the opioid addiction crisis through ownership of the company that manufactures the painkiller OxyContin.Like other suits that have been filed, this one alleges the Sackler family made a fortune by using deceptive marketing to sell addictive and potentially deadly painkillers. Eight people in a single family made the choices that caused much of the opioid epidemic, the suit says, then naming the eight defendants.Because they controlled their own privately held drug company, the Sackler Defendants had the power to decide how addictive narcotics were sold. They got more patients on opioids, at higher doses, for longer, than ever before. They paid themselves billions of dollars. They are responsible for addiction, overdose, and death that damaged millions of lives. They should be held accountable now.The lawsuit does not specify the amount of monetary damages sought. The suits seeks a number of actions, including having the Sacklers issue corrective advertising statements in national and regional publications, medical journals, television shows and websites.The plaintiffs say they deserve compensation because the opioid crisis increased costs for law enforcement, child care for children of people addicted to opioids and physical and mental health treatment. The plaintiffs also say property values decreased in some areas because of the drug epidemic.A spokesperson for the families of Drs. Mortimer and Raymond Sackler, the late founders of the company, issued this statement:These baseless allegations place blame where it does not belong for a complex public health crisis, and we deny them.  The company our fathers and grandfathers founded manufactures an FDA-approved medicine that has always represented a tiny portion of the opioid market -- never more than four percent of nationwide opioid prescriptions and currently less than two percent -- while providing life-changing relief for the millions of pain patients who need it.  While we have always acted properly, we remain committed to making a meaningful contribution to solutions that save lives by preventing diversion and abuse of prescription medicines and treating those who are suffering from addiction.Purdue Pharma also denied wrongdoing.This complaint is part of a continuing effort by contingency fee counsel to single out Purdue, blame it for the entire opioid crisis in the United States, and try the case in the court of public opinion rather than the justice system, according to a statement from Purdue spokesman Bob Josephson.The statement says the lawsuit is inaccurate and misleading. For example, the company says, the suit doesn't mention that Purdue's opioid pain medicines represent less than 2% of total opioid prescriptions.The suit also doesn't give Purdue Pharma credit for its work in trying to reduce opioid addiction, the statement said.Purdue Pharma and the individual former directors vigorously denies the allegations in the complaint and will continue to defend themselves against these misleading allegations. In the meantime, Purdue continues to fight for balance in the public discourse so that society can simultaneously help pain patients in need and create real solutions to the complex problem of addiction.The suit was filed March 18 in the Southern District of New York. Named as defendants are Richard S. Sackler, Jonathan D. Sackler, Mortimer D.A. Sackler, Kathe A. Sackler, Ilene Sackler Lefcourt, Beverly Sackler, Theresa Sackler, David A. Sackler,  a trust for members of the Raymond Sackler family and Rhodes Pharmaceuticals.Rhodes is a family-owned company that makes . The trust owns half of Purdue and the Purdue-related entities, the suit says. The plaintiffs include areas hard-hit by the opioid crisis, ranging from heavily populated places lsuch as Cleveland to small towns such as Opp, Alabama. There are 112 Massachusetts towns and counties among the plaintiffs and 51 in Kentucky. Eight native American tribes are also among the plaintiffs.The suit says the number of US drug overdose deaths has grown from 47,000 in 2014 to an estimated 72,000 in 2017, with three out of five deaths involving opioids.The suit says the family increased sales by creating a new 'health care' narrative -- one in which opioids are considered safe and effective for long-term use, and pain is aggressively treated at all costs. The suit says the family and its companies intentionally misled doctors and patients about the safe use of prescription opioids through sales representatives and through financial relationships with academic physicians, professional societies, hospitals, trade associations for state medical boards and seemingly neutral third-party foundations.The suit also asks the defendants to pay for the plaintiffs' attorney fees.CNN's Evan Simko-Bednarski and Tony Marco contributed to this report."},

In other words, as the forests increasingly become victims of climate change, they would also contribute to it.Carbon dynamics after a storm are hard to understand but after a storm a forest loses a lot of carbon and then regains it as it regrows, so we're looking at the long-term average, said Maria Uriarte, of Columbia University's Earth Institute, who led the research. If bad storms become the norm, if a storm of Maria's severity becomes the average storm in the Caribbean, we expect the forest will store less carbon because trees don't have time to get big. We expect the net balance to be negative -- that's not published yet but that's what our models are showing.Uriarte has been studying Puerto Rico's trees for the last 15 years. She returned to the island three months after her namesake hurricane and saw the damage to the forests in person.What was very striking is that, with tree species, there were winners and losers, she told CNN.I've been here a few times since the hurricane, and the recovery is very quick. There is a lot of damage but there is regrowth coming in -- but the composition [of the forests] is definitely going to change.Maria hit Puerto Rico as a , with winds of more than 155 miles (250 kilometers) per hour, and up to 500mm (20 inches) of rain falling over 24 hours. Last year, researchers from the University of California, Berkley, used remote sensing techniques to estimate that Maria may have killed or severely damaged across Puerto Rico. For this latest study, published this week in the journal Nature Communications, Uriarte and her team were able to examine the forests up close, to get a more detailed view of the damage done.They studied a 40-acre section of the , which has been monitored since the 1990s. That meant they had long-term data that let them compare damage from Maria with that of Hurricane Hugo, which struck the island in 1989, and Hurricane Georges from 1998.They found that Maria killed twice as many trees as Hugo and Georges -- both category 3 storms, and much less intense than Maria -- and broke more than three times as many trunks. Many of those with broken trunks will die in the next few years, according to Uriarte.One thing that was different between the storms is the percentage of trees that were broken, said Uriarte.  Really large trees that were just snapped in half -- and this is unique.For the researchers, this was a striking finding, as in the past the larger trees -- such as the mahogany-like tabonucos, used for making furniture and boats, and ausubos, which are so dense their wood doesn't float in water -- have been more resilient to storms. These are some of the trees that have denser wood, and trees with very dense wood historically have very low break rates and mortality rates, said Uriarte. This storm was different -- trees 100 years old or more were broken. A proportion of these trees will be able rebuild the biomass and recover, and a number of them won't.Exactly why these bigger, denser trees fared so badly is still being investigated. But the result is that the number of big hardwoods has dwindled, while other species -- particularly fast-growing palms, which bend in strong winds, rather than breaking -- have replaced them.Uriarte says this change in the composition of the forests could be something we see across the Atlantic Tropics -- with the trees overall becoming shorter and less dense, and the forests less biodiverse.Palms have less dense biomass than hardwood trees, and they store less carbon, said Uriarte.Yadvinder Malhi, a professor of Ecosystem Science at the University of Oxford, who wasn't involved in the research, said it was plausible that there would be a shift towards more faster-growing trees that grow quickly after a hurricane.In the long term the total amount of carbon stored in the forest depends on the recovery time between disturbances. It drops to near zero during the disturbance and slowly builds up and drops again, he said. So if those disturbances become more frequent and more intense, then the average over a century timescale will be lower.Scientists say that while climate change doesn't cause hurricanes, it is making oceans warmer, which is . Oceans have warmed an average of 1 to 3 degrees Fahrenheit over the past century and as they get warmer, scientists expect hurricanes to bring heavier rain and possibly stronger winds. Heavy rainfall tends to destabilize soil, causing more trees to uproot.The study notes that the expected changes in hurricane winds and rainfall may have profound consequences for the long-term resilience of tropical forests in the North Atlantic basin.As well as affecting carbon emissions, the changing forest makeup could affect the wildlife that lives there. For instance the endangered Puerto Rican parrot, which likes old, tall growth, can't nest because much of the forest is disturbed, said Uriarte. Species that favor an open forest environment will do better, she adds. "},
{"title": "The 'bliss point,' or why you can't just eat one cookie or potato chip", "cate": "health", "content": "Have you ever found yourself staring at an empty bag of cookies you just devoured? Don't beat yourself up. Your brain is wired to eat that cookie -- and the next 10. It's as automatic a response as running away from a loud noise. But resisting the cookies (or chips, or cakes, or chocolate-covered pretzels) doesn't have to feel like a constant cage match between willpower and craving. You can use the same science that food manufacturers use to make junk foods biologically irresistible to your advantage. To our caveman ancestors, sugar, salt and fat were necessary for survival, so they evolved to crave it. But since those foods were rare, our ancestors didn't need much in terms of willpower. That's why the region of our brain that regulates willpower is evolutionarily younger and easily overridden by the more primitive cravings-driven region. But in the past 200 years, we started producing foods that are nothing but straight sugar, salt or fat. Our environment changed, but our brains and bodies couldn't adapt to the sudden onslaught of junky but highly rewarding food. Junk foods specifically triggers our brain's , the same area where drugs and alcohol act. Every time you eat sugar, your brain releases dopamine (the happy hormone), and you feel good. In fact, food manufacturers spend millions to find the bliss point for each food: that irresistible ratio of sugar, salt and fat. These foods bypass our normal fullness mechanisms, which is why you could eat them all day and not feel full. Over time, your body becomes less sensitive to these foods, so you have to eat more just to get the same dopamine rush and feel withdrawal if you don't get it. It's like a designer drug in an easy-to-open package. Also, since our brains love sugar, food manufacturers have added it to pretty much everything. Today, 74% of , including salad dressing, barbecue sauce and pasta sauce. Kid-specific foods average  than the adult versions. Not only does sugar add calories, but hidden sugar is like giving your brain a constant hit that only amps up cravings. We're first going to end the cage match between cravings and willpower. In my work, I've found ways to sidestep the boxing ring with what I call Minimum Viable Actions: the smallest, most science-backed steps that can trigger healthy behaviors with the least possible effort. Don't start by trying to resist that cookie head-on. To tackle sugar cravings, first reduce the hidden sugars in your diet, and over time, you'll become more sensitive to sweet (and need less). Unfortunately, food labeling laws means you need to be a sugar sleuth; some juices labeled no added sugar have more sugar than a can of soda! How to tell? Follow my Rule of 5s. Read the first five items in the ingredients list to look for sugar by any name (there are more than ): anything ending in -ose, cane (sugar, crystals), corn (syrup, sweetener), rice syrup, honey or others.  If it doesn't pass the Rule of 5s, it's a dessert, and you should find an alternative. Second, embrace new flavors. Most processed foods are based on sugar and salt. But we forget the three other big ones: sour, bitter and umami. These three flavors have a lower satiety threshold, meaning they're more filling, without salt or sugar. Dress up meats or vegetables with umami flavors (pickled vegetables, cured meats, mushrooms, tomato paste, miso soup, low-sodium soy sauce and hard-aged cheeses such as Parmesan) for a hearty flavor. Over time, you'll notice salty cravings start to fall. Third, maintain portion control when it comes to high-bliss-point foods. We don't stop eating these kinds of food when we're full, we stop when the food in front of us runs out. Use that to your advantage. When people are given several smaller individually wrapped bars,  than if they're given the same total amount in a large chocolate bar. So acknowledge your caveman brain and scoop out a set portion. Even if you still go back for seconds (totally normal), you'll eat less than if you had the entire bag.So, when you hear Betcha' can't eat just one, that's not just a cutesy slogan. It's a promise. Or a threat. Don't try to fight it head-on. If you want to win, get out of the boxing ring.  is an emergency physician and author of . "},
{"title": "Who is having more sex over age 50, research explores", "cate": "health", "content": "The number of people you have sex with is an individual choice. But certain lifestyle factors play a role in how many sex partners you have, explains a recent study by British researchers. While previous research on sexual behavior and its potential risks has tended to focus on teens and young adults, this study looked at the determinants for number of sexual partners in more than 7,000 men and women age 50 and older. The researchers found some interesting correlations between the subjects' sex lives and specific sociodemographic and behavioral factors, which they say could help clinicians identify people at greater risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs). To get a better grasp of what these findings might mean, I asked some of my colleagues to weigh in on the data. Men in this study were more likely to report a higher number of lifetime sex partners than women. Forty percent of men said theyhad at least five partners, compared with 24% of women. Likewise, being gay was associated with having more sexual partners among men. That's not surprising, said sex therapist Dulcinea Pitagora. Because our culture socializes men \u2014 regardless of sexual orientation \u2014 to believe that they should be more sexually active than other genders, they may feel they have permission to be more sexually active, or they may feel like they have to present that appearance, she explained. In fact, this is much more of a 'male' issue than a 'gay' issue, added sex therapist Kimberly Resnick Anderson. Men have ten times more testosterone than women (at all stages of life), so gay men share a hormonal push for sexual outlet, whereas heterosexual couples must contend with often discrepant biologic drives. For men, and older men in particular, economic status also seemed to increase the overall number of sex partners. That was true for both men in the top 20% of income and those in the lowest 20% . Although that may seem odd, it may actually make some sense. Wealthier men have less stress about day-to-day necessities. There is more emotional space for pleasure and more time to have it, since they may not be working as much as a person with fewer financial resources, explained sex therapist Holly Richmond. On the flip side, for men with less money, having sex with multiple partners may be a distraction from the social burden of having a lower income.The researchers identified some intriguing characteristics for women, too. For example, they found that women who were white, bisexual, physically active, or free of chronic illness were more likely to have a higher number of sex partners. The latter three factors aren't surprising: Regular exercise likely translates to a better body image \u2014 and, in turn, more confidence to pursue sex \u2014 while good health makes it easier to engage in sexual activity without discomfort. The healthier and more vital one is, the more sex they tend to have said sex therapist Lawrence Siegel. Bisexuality may also be associated with increased confidence, as well as greater opportunity for sex partners. But what about race? In the past few decades, women who identify as white have been receiving messages about how to feel liberated sexually \u2014 Sex and the City is a great example of such influence, said psychosexual therapist Sara Nasserzadeh. But women of other ethnicities \u2014 mainly outside of North America and Western Europe \u2014 may not feel comfortable expressing desire or experiences with multiple partners.Some factors spanned across all genders. For both men and women, being younger, separated or divorced, single or never married was associated with a higher number of sexual partners. When we consider factors like being younger \u2014say, 51 rather than 78 \u2014 being separated or divorced, single, or never married, this creates space for more ego-driven, self-focused sexual behavior rather than having to worry about a partner's feelings, children or increased health problems that come from advanced age, explained Richmond. These dimensions allow them to be in it for themselves and have less concern about other people's perceptions of their behaviors.What's more, certain habits could have an effect on one's number of sex partners. The study found that being a current or former smoker and drinking alcohol regularly or frequently were linked to a higher number of sex partners in both men and women. These might be people who tend to be greater risk takers or seek out more stimulation, which could apply to their sexuality as well as use of nicotine or alcohol, said Pitagora. Additionally, those who drink alcohol sometimes enjoy being disinhibited as a result, which might flow over into their sexual expression as well. Regular drinkers may also frequent bars or other public spaces, giving them more opportunities to hook up.Remember, though, that this study could only show associations between certain factors and sexual activity, not cause and effect. Having such characteristics won't determine your number of sexual partners \u2014 that's a choice that only you can control.Ian Kerner is a licensed couples therapist, writer and contributor on the topic of sex for CNN.

{"title": "Do you lose nutrients when juicing fruits and veggies? Yes, actually", "cate": "health", "content": "Juice extracted from fruits and veggies will contain concentrated amounts of vitamins, minerals, and other plant nutrients. If you tend to avoid fresh, frozen or canned fruits and veggies, juicing can provide a convenient and refreshing way to get a healthy dose of nutrients that are easily absorbed.  But when juicing fruits and vegetables, some of the healthy, filling fiber is lost. That's because juice extractors separate the juice from the fiber-rich pulp and skins.  You do lose fiber in fruit and vegetable juices, and that results in juices having the ability to spike your blood sugar in a more dramatic way than if you ate the actual fruit or vegetable, said Robin Foroutan, an integrative medicine dietitian and spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.  In addition to fiber, you also lose some polyphenols and antioxidants found in the pith of citrus fruits and skins of fruits and vegetables that may not be extracted as effectively in home juicing, explained Mario G. Ferruzzi, a professor in the Department of Food, Bioprocessing and Nutrition Sciences at North Carolina State University.If you do choose to juice, don't delay drinking. It is best to drink the juice right away, because antioxidant and enzyme activity decreases over time, Foroutan said.  Antioxidants help to balance inflammation, while enzymes (like those found in pineapple) help with digestion. If you are juicing and plan on drinking the juice later, it's best to store it in an airtight glass container, refrigerate and consume within one day, Foroutan explained.Cold-pressed juicers don't create heat the way centrifuge juicers do, and heat destroys enzymes in produce. However, centrifuge juicers likely don't get hot enough to actually destroy enzymes or oxidize nutrients, Foroutan explained. I don't think the heat generated would be enough that it would kill enzymes or nutrients in the way cooking does, Foroutan said. To minimize fiber loss, you can combine some of the pulp back into the juice.  You can also salvage the pulp by using it to fortify other foods, such as cake or muffin batters, cooked rice or soups, according to the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.Another option is to use a food processor or blender instead of a juicer to make fruit or vegetable juice. This will allow the fiber-rich pulp to remain in the juice, which can keep you feeling fuller longer.One study revealed that blending provides other benefits over juicing. Specifically, juices that had been prepared by blending whole fruits had stronger antioxidant activities and contained larger amounts of phenolic compounds than juices that had been prepared by juicing the flesh of fruit. However,  in apple, pear and mandarin orange juice was significantly higher in juice that had been processed by juicing, rather than blending. While juicing can help you consume important nutrients, it shouldn't displace whole fruits and vegetables in your diet. Also, simply changing the form of fruits and veggies won't help you lose weight or get rid of toxins, despite popular health claims. In fact, limiting your diet to drinking fruit or vegetables can cause you to miss out on important nutrients such as protein and healthy fats.  Finally, keep in mind that while juices contain natural sugars, they are still a concentrated source of calories, even for some vegetable juices such as carrot or beet. So if you are watching your blood sugar levels or trying to keep carbs or calories in check, be sure to watch your portions of juice and limit to 4 ounces, or \u00bd cup.

{"title": "Another promising Alzheimer's drug trial ends in failure: 'This one hurts'", "cate": "health", "content": "It's another devastating blow in the search for a treatment for patients living with Alzheimer's disease.Pharmaceutical giant Biogen and its Japanese partner Eisai announced Thursday they were halting two phase three clinical trials of a drug that targets the buildup in the brain of beta-amyloid, one of two proteins that researchers believecontribute to the development of Alzheimer's.The drug, called aducanumab, was the  in a field that has been littered with failures. It was so promising that the company was running two phase three trials simultaneously, said neurologist Dr. Richard Isaacson, who directs the This was the closest to the finish line and early results showed not only could we improve cognitive function but also get rid of amyloid in the brain, Isaacson said. This was the most hopeful thing we had -- in fact I have patients who are in the study, patients that are waiting to get into the trials.This one hurts, Isaacson said. Alzheimer's patients just can't get a break. The amyloid hypothesis says it's the accumulation of beta-amyloid in the brain that is the primary cause of the memory-destroying disease. Studies on mice showed that removing the buildup worked wonders, and the hypothesis has been the driving force behind Alzheimer's research for over 20 years.Yet all attempts to develop amyloid-targeting drugs in people with the disease have ended in failure.It was a huge gamble from the start, said Harvard neurologist Dr. Rudy Tanzi, who directs the Genetics and Aging Research Unit at Massachusetts General Hospital.We know that amyloid deposition starts a decade or so before symptoms and it's too late to treat it then, Tanzi said. It's like trying to put out a forest fire by putting out the match. Instead, he said, drug makers should be focusing on early detection and early intervention, similar to how we treat cancer, diabetes and heart disease.It has to be early detection and early treatment, years before symptoms begin, for it to work, Tanzi said. When is big pharma going to learn?In late 2016, Eli Lilly's solanezumab failed to surpass placebo benefits in a phase three trial of 2,100 patients. In 2013, Pfizer scrapped another antibody, bapineuzumab, when it didn't surpass placebo effects in another phase three trial. Experts suggest that the advanced stages of Alzheimer's among study participants in both trials might have contributed to the failures.Drug giant Merck used a different approach to fight beta-amyloid in people with late-stage Alzheimer's with its BACE inhibitor verubecestat but admitted defeat in early 2017 after an independent study found that it had virtually no chance of working. A second attempt to treat earlier stages of Alzehimer's was also scrapped in February.Johnson & Johnson's BACE inhibitor atabecestat, designed to slow cognitive decline in people at risk for Alzheimer's, was also shelved in May 2018 when liver enzymes spiked in study participants.The decision to stop the aducanumab trials was not due to any safety concerns, but on the results of a futility analysis conducted by an independent data monitoring committee. It found the trials were unlikely to meet their primary goals at completion.This disappointing news confirms the complexity of treating Alzheimer's disease and the need to further advance knowledge in neuroscience, Michel Vounatsos, chief executive officer at Biogen, said  We are incredibly grateful to all the Alzheimer's disease patients, their families and the investigators who participated in the trials and contributed greatly to this research.Details from the trials will be presented at future conferences to inform the scientific community and enlighten ongoing research.Those finer details may uncover ways in which amyloid-attacking drugs might be helpful to those diagnosed with Alzheimer's, Isaacson said.And they will certainly help educate those who are working on prevention and early diagnosis and treatment.I don't think we should lose hope, Isaacson said. We understand that Alzheimer's is a lifestyle disease and we need to intervene early to stop the progression.So I do think that there's hope for this approach for prevention, he added. But as for treatment for patients living with the disease now, this one hurts."},

That's because the young couple in the movie, portrayed by Cole Sprouse and Haley Lu Richardson, reminds him a lot of his late son and daughter-in-law.In 2015, Katie and Dalton Prager became known around the world as the real 'Fault in Our Stars' couple after wrote about their love story.Like the couple in Five Feet Apart,  had cystic fibrosis and pursued a relationship even though doctors forbid cystic fibrosis patients from standing less than 6 feet apart from each other, because they can share deadly infections.Dalton and Katie did share an infection, and they  five days apart in 2016. He was 25, and she was 26. Dalton's fear was that he'd be forgotten, so if the way the movie is telling this cystic fibrosis story, if it's tied to Dalton in any way, that's a blessing right there, Prager said.Is Five Feet Apart inspired by the Pragers' love story?The film is fiction and not based on the Pragers, CBS Films, which produced the movie, wrote in an email. The filmmakers did not meet nor engage with the Pragers, and the Five Feet Apart story and script is not based on them or their family.He added that the initial spark for the movie was born from a conversation with Claire Wineland, who would go on to serve as medical consultant on the film.Wineland, a social media star and inspirational speaker who started a to support families living with cystic fibrosis, of complications of a massive stroke in Septembersoon after she received a lung transplant. Her mother, Melissa Nordquist Yeager, says Wineland was aware of the Pragers' story when her friend, actor and producer Justin Baldoni, approached her in January 2017 about making a movie about two young people with cystic fibrosis.Absolutely, Claire was following Dalton and Katie's story, Yeager said. It was a cautionary tale but also a very human story. Who can help falling in love with who they fall in love with?There's a piece of their story in the movie, she added.Yeager remembers how the cystic fibrosis community, which is relatively small, lived through the ups and downs of Katie and Dalton's story.We were all cheering them on when he got his lung transplant and then she got hers. We all had high hopes, she said.However, Yeager noted some major differences between the Pragers' story and the couple in the movie. For example, Stella Grant and Will Newman, the fictional couple, meet at the hospital and at first are antagonistic toward one another.The Pragers met on Facebook and fell in love almost instantly. Katie wanted to meet Dalton in person, even though she knew that he had , a life-threatening infection for people with cystic fibrosis.I told Dalton I'd rather be happy -- like really, really happy -- for five years of my life and die sooner than be mediocre happy and live for 20 years, Katie said.Dalton drove in from Missouri to meet Katie in Kentucky.My heart was racing, but I just went right up to him and hugged and kissed him on the mouth without even saying hello, she said in 2015. I'm usually not that kind of girl, but it just felt so right.Dalton and Katie both received lung transplants. He lived for two years with his new lungs, and Katie for about 14 months.Will and Stella's Hollywood love story has a more upbeat ending than Dalton and Katie's real-life love story.Despite these differences, Yeager says there are aspects of Katie and Dalton's lives, as well as the lives of other people with cystic fibrosis, in the movie.She hopes that gives Dalton and Katie's parents some comfort. I hope they can take pride knowing that their children's story contributed to making a major motion picture in ways that very few people can, she said.Katie's mother cries when she hears that Wineland, the consultant on the film, was aware of her daughter's story.It's just really overwhelming to think that Katie, coming from this little town in Kentucky, could touch so many people, Debra Donovan said.She remembers how her daughter loved to help others, even mailing colorful drawings and sweet notes to sick children she read about online. Katie would be happy to know that she was, even in a small way, an inspiration for a movie that brings attention to cystic fibrosis.I think if she knew about all this, she would feel like she didn't waste her life, Donovan said.Donovan doesn't plan on seeing Five Feet Apart anytime soon. It's too emotionally difficult.Dalton's father isn't sure when he'll see the movie, but he knows he'll bring that box of tissues.In the meantime, it's enough for him to know that Dalton might have played even a small role in a movie that educates people about his son's disease. He remembers how his son was bullied in high school for being short and skinny and having coughing fits. Maybe this film could make a difference.I'm sitting here right now with a big smile on my face knowing that he did touch people's lives, Prager said.CNNs Jessica Ravitz and John Bonifield contributed to this report."},

Hopping on the elliptical or going for a jog definitely provides brain benefits, but according to one study, cardio in the form of dance shows even more benefits. Not only does dancing increase hippocampal volume, but it also increases brain regions linked with neuroplasticity. This means that there's an increase in the neural networks' ability to change their connections and behavior in response to sensory stimulation or new information. To start the day, I recommend my weight loss clients crank up their favorite song to wake up their mind and their body. Get out of bed and start off your morning fitness routine by dancing to your favorite song for a few minutes. Move your arms, legs and hips to loosen up and bust out a few dance moves in the privacy of your own home. Outside of your morning fitness routine, think about attending cardio dance classes like Zumba instead of hopping on the treadmill.

Open your feet as wide as your hips, pull your naval in toward your spine, and then squat down as if you're about to sit in a chair. As you squat down, swing your arms straight up and overhead. Press down through your heels to stand up, and bring the arms back down to your sides. Repeat this 20 times. In addition to your morning routine, add a strength training exercise two or three days per week of into your workouts. For example, 10 side lunges on each side will strengthen the lower body. For a modification, only lower into a half lunge on each side. Next, walk your hands forward into a plank position with shoulders over the wrists. Hold the plank for 10 seconds or perform 10 push-ups. If push-ups in this position are too challenging, you can lower onto your knees to do them. Finally, lie on the ground with your legs up toward the ceiling and then lower them down a few inches, then back up. This will work your abs and the core. Lower your legs further toward the floor to increase difficulty. Repeat this three-move circuit three times during your next workout.Finally, to wrap up your morning routine, center yourself with a breathing and movement routine.  found that participants who connected breath to yoga postures showed significant improvements in their sustained attention compared to those who didn't focus on breathing. However, all yoga practitioners in the study exhibited a reduction in perceived stress and better attention span. So, for your final move in the morning fitness routine, we'll stand up tall after you've completed your 20 squats. Press down through all 10 toes and your feet. Inhale as you reach your arms out to the side and up toward the ceiling, press your palms together and exhale as you bring the palms down through the center of your chest. Repeat this 10 times, linking your breath with each movement. Inhale to reach the arms up, and exhale to bring the palms together down through the center of the chest.After a few weeks of doing this morning fitness routine, change it up!

The last time kale was on the list was in 2009 when it was ranked eighth. Strawberries and spinach took the top two spots again this year, respectively, followed by kale.Since 2004, the group -- a nonprofit, nonpartisan environmental organization -- has annually ranked pesticide contamination in popular fruits and vegetables for its , noting those with the highest and lowest concentration of pesticides after being washed or peeled.  include an array of chemicals that kill unwanted insects, plants, molds and rodents. These chemicals keep pests from destroying produce but also expose humans to residues through their diet. This guide shares the results of the 47 tested fruits and vegetables, so consumers can buy foods with lower amounts of pesticides. The Dirty Dozen and Clean Fifteen, a list of the top 15 tested produce contaminated with the least amounts of pesticide, are based off more than 40,900 fruit and vegetable samples tested by the Food and Drug Administration and the United States Department of Agriculture. The types and amounts of pesticides used vary based upon pests and weather, according to EWG.Analysis of recent data showed that 70% of this produce sold for consumption contained pesticide residues. While pesticides are used to protect growing fruits and vegetables, they can also endanger humans, per the . Human consumption of pesticides has been shown by studies to be associated with ,  and other health concerns. EWG research analyst Carla Burns explained in statement, The main route of pesticide exposure for most Americans who do not live or work on or near farms is through their diet.

Fear shouldn't be a part of the decision whether to buy foods on the pesticide list, said Teresa Thorne, executive director of the Alliance for Food and Farming, a non-profit that represents organic and conventional farmers of fruits and vegetables.Thorne noted a past study in the  that was critical of EWG's Dirty Dozen list, and found that eating organic produce didn't decrease consumer risk. That's largely because residues are so low, if present at all, she said.Research on the effects of pesticides on humans is ongoing, and there is not a complete understanding of whether there is a particular amount of pesticides considered to be safe. The  acknowledges there are reasons to be concerned about the exposure of developing children to pesticides, especially before birth. Concerns include effects on development and behavior. In order of pesticide concentration, 2019's Dirty Dozen list is: strawberries, spinach, kale, nectarines, apples, grapes, peaches, cherries, pears, tomatoes, celery and potatoes. Among these, kale and spinach contained 1.1 to 1.8 times more pesticide residue in weight than other batches of produce. This list varies, as does pesticide use in agriculture. The types and amount of pesticides a grower uses is going to depend upon the pests that the grower is dealing with and the weather.

The most common pesticide detected was , also known as DCPA, and has been identified as a potential cancer-causing agent. Europe has prohibited its use since 2009. Produce that are among the top of the list for reducing the exposure of consumers to pesticides include avocados, sweet corn, pineapples, frozen sweet peas and onions. In contrast to the Dirty Dozen, there was no detection of pesticide residues in 70% of these foods. Less than 1% of avocados and sweet corn tested positive for pesticides and were considered the cleanest of the list. The recommendations from the Environmental Working Group are to buy and eat organic produce, especially fruits and vegetables found on the Dirty Dozen list. However, if your budget does not allow you to eat organic, fruits and vegetables are better than none. The science shows that what people need to know is to eat more fruits and vegetables every day, conventional or organic,  choose either. No list needed, said Thorne of the Alliance for Food and Farming."},

Her family faced the harsh reality their newborn's survival rate was 5-10%. But Lewis beat the odds and now, 34 years later, she works in the same NICU that saved her life.I was the smallest surviving baby in the state of Texas, at the time, Lewis said. I was born at 24 weeks. Normal gestation is 40 weeks.Lewis spent the first 3\u00bd months of her life in the NICU at Scott and White Hospital, now named She was a micro-preemie and had tubes hooked up to her to help her tiny lungs breathe. Years later, she works alongside some of the same doctors and nurses who treated her as an infant. I wanted to be able to give back to the patients and families in the same situation that I was in, said Lewis. When deciding what career she wanted to pursue after high school, it was between teaching and the medical field. Once I started researching the medical field, I talked to a program director and immediately fell in love with it, said Lewis.This is where God was leading me to be.in 2009, Lewis started working as a respiratory therapist at McLane, in Temple, Texas, which serves central Texas. It's home to a level four NICU, which is the highest level of care. In her daily job, she connects ventilators and breathing tubes, just like the ones that helped her breathe as a baby.As I work, I get daily remainders of how blessed I am to be here today, she said.Lewis has two children, 6 and 3, but neither was a micro-preemie. My oldest threatened to be a preemie at 37 weeks.As she treats patients, she brings hope to the families as she shares her story of survival and motherhood with them.You see parents get rough news and need some brightness and hope in the day, she said. There are success stories and I am one of them.The hospital features her on its Hall of Hope, where it highlights babies with difficult journeys who have survived. Lewis said workers in the NICU become like a part of the patients' families, because they work so closely monitoring the infant, all with the goal of getting the babies healthy enough to go home.There are lots of long hard days that everyone puts in and it's very rewarding to see them grown up.A highlight of her work, Lewis said, is seeing those babies come back to visit.

The meeting, which will be open to the public, comes just days after the  to two breast implant manufacturers for failing to comply with the agency's requirements to conduct long-term studies assessing the safety and risks of their silicone gel-filled implants. The committee plans to discuss reports of breast implants being linked to a rare cancer called ; the use of registries for maintaining breast implant surveillance; and best practices for informed consent discussions between patients and clinicians, among other topics. We've also heard from patients who are concerned that their implants may be connected to other health conditions that could be associated with their immune system's response to these devices, resulting in symptoms like chronic fatigue, cognitive issues and muscle pain, FDA commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb and Dr. Jeff Shuren, director of the Center for Devices and Radiological Health,  earlier this month.While the FDA doesn't have definitive evidence suggesting breast implants are associated with these conditions, we're looking to gain a fuller understanding of this issue to communicate risk, minimize harm and help in the treatment of affected patients. This topic will be discussed at our upcoming two-day public meeting, the statement said.  Along with agency officials, the meeting will involve input from some experts, including representatives from the American Society of Plastic Surgeons.The ASPS worked closely with the FDA in  to  in 2012, and then last year to create an overall , said Dr. Alan Matarasso, , which represents about 93% of all board-certified plastic surgeons in the United States and thousands worldwide. We are in regular communication with the FDA to share data and insights about patient safety, Matarasso said.Breast implants are among the most studied medical devices in the world, and they will continue to be so, he said. Hundreds of thousands of patients each year in the US opt for breast implants and report no adverse effects.

The benefits and risks of breast implants, which will be discussed in the meeting, remain important and sit at the forefront of plastic and reconstructive surgery, Addona said, adding that he often discusses benefits and risks with his own patients.We do discuss complications. Those range from scarring around the implant, sometimes soreness and discomfort from the implant ... to in the last seven years, probably a bit more, we've become more acutely aware of a specific type of lymphoma that is associated with breast implants, he said.

{"title": "Daily or high-potency cannabis increases risk of psychotic disorder, study finds", "cate": "health", "content": "Legalization of marijuana, both for medical and recreational use, continues to spread across the globe even as the possible health risks (or benefits) are not fully known. Case in point, according to people who use cannabis daily, as well as those who use high-potency weed, may be three times more likely to develop psychotic disorder than never-users. Published Tuesday in the journal the Lancet Psychiatry, the new evidence is consistent with previous experiments that suggest heavy use and high THC concentration cannabis -- a 10% concentration of THC (the psychoactive substance within cannabis) or higher -- can be harmful to mental health. Psychotic disorder, precisely, is what was studied, said , lead author and a clinician scientist at the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, King's College London. We are talking about people who meet diagnostic criteria [and] come to the attention of mental health services to receive treatment for psychosis. So they have to have symptoms of psychosis across the spectrum -- so hallucination, delusion -- that have lasted at least for a week.Currently, medical cannabis is legal in most European countries, though recreational use is only legal in the Netherlands, Spain (under certain conditions), and Czech Republic. Many countries, though, are discussing legalization. In the United States, 10 states and the District of Columbia allow recreational sales of marijuana, while 34 states allow medical marijuana use.To understand whether there's a connection between cannabis and psychosis, Di Forti and her co-authors looked at data from five countries in Europe -- the UK, the Netherlands, France, Spain and Italy -- and Brazil, where cannabis is illegal. They found 901 patients with a first-time episode of psychosis over a five-year period and compared them to 1,237 matched non-patients.  Daily use of cannabis was more common among patients with psychosis compared to the controls, they found. About 30% of patients reported using cannabis daily compared to just 7% of non-patient controls. And use of high potency cannabis was also more common among patients than controls: 37% compared to 19%. Overall, people who used marijuana on a daily basis were three times more likely to have a first episode psychosis compared with people who never used weed, the researchers estimated. And this increased to five times more likely for those who daily used high-potency cannabis.  High-potency cannabis contributes to incidence of psychotic disorder but doesn't explain it completely, explained Di Forti, noting that only some users develop a psychotic disorder and the reasons why not all cannabis users are equally susceptible is unclear. Still, the new study may be helpful with regard to medicinal cannabis, since some of those products may include small amounts of THC. For example, maybe psychosis should be listed among the potential side effects, she said. The study results do not provide enough information for her to say use only this amount, only this often to remain safe. Still, she and her co-authors estimated that one in five new cases of psychosis may be linked to daily cannabis use, and one in 10 cases linked to use of high potency cannabis.senior author of the study and a professor of psychiatric research at the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience at King's College London, said that 15 years ago nobody thought cannabis increased the risk for psychosis. Only gradually has evidence come out and shown that to be true, he said. Gradually, too, other explanations have been chipped away, he said: For example, some people might say that  perhaps a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia led some people to use cannabis and this is the reason for higher rates of psychosis. But rules this out, said Murray:  There may be some genetic component but it's not the major reason. In light of the new results, is legalized cannabis a good idea? Personally, I think it's much more important that people are educated, said Murray. Tobacco is legal, but we've seen the consumption plummet because there's been a sustained educational campaign. and a psychiatrist at University College London, told Science Media Centre that the new study is both important and well conducted research that adds weight to the advice that people who use cannabis recreationally should avoid high-THC cannabis. Bloomfield was not involved in the new study. Nor was , registrar at the Royal College of Psychiatrists, who told Science Media Centre that the research is good quality and the results need to be taken seriously.Cannabis carries severe health risks and users have a higher chance of developing psychosis, said James. The risks are increased when the drug is high in potency, used by children and young people and when taken frequently., a professor of Psychiatry & Cognitive Neuroscience at King's College London, told CNN that the study's finding that cannabis use is higher among patients with psychosis is not itself new. Still the study involves relatively large numbers of subjects and has controlled for other risk factors that might have accounted for the results and in that way adds to what is known about marijuana, said McGuire, who played no part in the new research. Cannabis contains two ingredients that have opposite effects on psychosis: THC induces psychotic symptoms and cannabidiol, known as CBD, reduces them, he explained.His own research has shown that if healthy volunteers are given THC this induces transient psychotic symptoms like paranoia. However, if volunteers are given CBD beforehand, this blocks the induction of psychotic symptoms by THC, said McGuire.McGuire and his co-researchers found that adding CBD to regular antipsychotic medication reduced psychotic symptoms in patients with schizophrenia. When we used brain scanning to measure the effects of CBD and THC on brain function, we found that they have opposite effects on brain activity, which may explain why they have opposite effects on psychotic symptoms, he said.  The net effect of cannabis that contains both THC and CBD depends on the relative amounts of each, he explained. The cannabis that was available in the 1960s was relatively low in THC and high in CBD. However, these days illicit cannabis is often 'high potency,' with a high THC content and a low CBD content.We are currently conducting research to define the ratio of CBD:THC in cannabis that is optimal for minimizing its psychotic effects, he said.

{"title": "Her son died. And then anti-vaxers attacked her", "cate": "health", "content": "Not long ago, a 4-year-old boy died of the flu. His mother, under doctor's orders, watched his two little brothers like a hawk, terrified they might get sick and die, too.    Grieving and frightened, just days after her son's death she checked her Facebook page hoping to read messages of comfort from family and friends. Instead, she found dozens of hateful comments: You're a terrible mother. You killed your child. You deserved what happened to your son. This is all fake - your child doesn't exist.  Bewildered and rattled, she closed her Facebook app.  A few days later she received a text message from someone named Ron.  Expect more like this, Ron warned. Expect more.  The attacks were from those who oppose vaccination, and this mother, who lives in the Midwest, doesn't want her name used for fear the attention would only encourage more messages. Interviews with mothers who've lost children and with those who spy on anti-vaccination groups, reveal a tactic employed by anti-vaxers: When a child dies, members of the group sometimes encourage each other to go on that parent's Facebook page. The anti-vaxers then post messages telling the parents they're lying and their child never existed or that the parent murdered them, or that vaccines killed the child, or some combination of all of those.  Nothing is considered too cruel. Just days after their children died, mothers say anti-vaxers on social media called them whores, the c-word and baby killers.  The mother in the Midwest, who wants to remain anonymous, isn't alone. Jill Promoli, who lives outside Toronto, lost her son to flu. She believes the anti-vaxers are trying to silence the very people who can make the strongest argument for vaccinations: those whose children died of vaccine-preventable illnesses.   Flu took the life of Promoli's 2-year-old son, Jude McGee, three years ago. She's since started a  in his name for flu prevention, including vaccination.   I know that these people are really trying to hurt me, and I understand that the reason they're doing it is because they want me to stop, she said.   Larry Cook, the founder of Stop Mandatory Vaccination, doesn't deny that such attacks on mothers of dead children exist.  In an email to CNN, he wrote that members of his group make more than half a million comments on the group's Facebook page each month.  Any discussions about parents who lose their children after those children are vaccinated would be minor in number, and even smaller would be the number of members reaching out to parents in private message to share their concerns that vaccines may have played a role in a death, Cook wrote. I do not condone violent behavior or tone and encourage decorum during discussion, Cook wrote, adding that anyone who deliberately engage[s] in the politics of advocating for compulsory vaccination where children may be further damaged through government vaccine mandates can expect push back and resistance, alongside knowledgable discussions about vaccine risk in social media commentary.  Cook said some of the more than 160,000 members of his group have been targets of harassment campaigns, and that police have actually showed up at my members' doorsteps.  He added that he's been threatened and included a screenshot of a private Facebook message that said, Finally found where you live. Finally I'll be able to put a bullet in you. You are dead.   Another anti-vaccination leader blamed the postings on grieving parents' pages on infiltrators who try to create incendiary situations.  I tell everybody that you should look at the person you're talking to and those on the other side of this discussion and recognize that they care about children, too, said Del Bigtree, chief executive officer of the Informed Consent Action Network.During the public comment period at a meeting last month of the US Center for Disease Control's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, more than a dozen people spoke about their concerns about vaccines. Some said they or their loved ones had been injured by vaccines.  My older son suffered documented illness and regression following vaccination, said Jackie Martin-Sebell. These vaccines are not safe for everyone.  Another speaker, Rilei Cherry, said her son developed autism as a result of vaccines. We owe it to our children to truly look at the long term effects of vaccines and be honest about what could happen to our children, she told the CDC committee.  Despite the speakers' concerns, more than a dozen  have shown that vaccines do not cause autism. The  says Vaccines are safe. Vaccines are effective. Vaccines save lives.  On May 6, 2016, Promoli put her toddlers Jude and his twin brother Thomas, down for an afternoon nap in their home. Jude had a low-grade fever, but he was laughing and singing when he went down for his nap.  When his mother went to check on him two hours later, he was dead.  Promoli said the next few weeks were a living hell.  Having to go in and plan a funeral and find the ability somehow to even take steps to walk into a funeral home, to make plans and decide whether to bury or cremate your child -- it was just all so horrifying, she said.  When an autopsy came back showing Jude had died of the flu, Promoli started her flu prevention campaign.   That's when the online attacks began.  Some anti-vaxers told her she'd murdered Jude and made up a story about the flu to cover up her crime. Others said vaccines had killed her son. Some called her the c-word.  The worst ones -- the ones that would sometimes make her cry -- were the posts that said she was advocating for flu shots so that other children would die from the shots and their parents would be miserable like she was.  The first time it made me feel really sick because I couldn't fathom how anybody could even come up with such a terrible claim, Promoli said. It caught me off guard in its cruelty. What kind of a person does this?  Twisted logic that relies on scientific lies doesn't bother Promoli so much anymore. She's continued with her flu shot campaign, persuading Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to publicize his flu shot.  I've had to grow some very thick skin, she said.  She said no matter how many nasty messages she's received -- and she says she's received hundreds -- she'll continue her campaign.  The work that we're doing might mean that somebody else doesn't have to go plan a funeral for their toddler, and that is everything, she said.  Other mothers have also persevered despite attacks from anti-vaxers.  Serese Marotta lost her 5-year-old son, Joseph, to the flu in 2009, and is now chief operating officer of Families Fighting Flu, a group that encourages flu awareness and prevention, including vaccination.  In 2017, she posted a video on the eighth anniversary of her son's death to reinforce the importance of getting the flu vaccine.  SLUT, one person commented. PHARMA WHORE.  May you rot in hell for all the damages you do! a Facebook user wrote on another one of her posts.  She says a Facebook user in Australia sent her a death threat.  She called me a lot of names I won't repeat and used the go-to conspiracy theories about government and big pharma, and I responded, 'I lost a child,' and questioned where she was coming from, and she continued to attack me, said Marotta, who lives in Syracuse, New York.  Catherine and Greg Hughes, an Australian couple who lost their 1-month old son, Riley, to whooping cough, have also received online abuse. Too young to be vaccinated, Riley relied on herd immunity -- the vaccinations of others -- to protect him.   But herd immunity didn't protect him, since the area where the Hughes family lived in Perth has some of the lowest vaccination rates in Australia.  Riley's death was a very inconvenient truth for anti-vaccine activists, Catherine said. The nasty messages started 24 hours after he died. They called us baby killers and said we would have the blood of other babies on our hands. We've been told to kill ourselves.  The couple started a vaccination , Light for Riley.  Catherine said they still receive vile comments years after Riley's death.  [F**k] you, Hughes family, one Facebook user wrote on the Light for Riley page. What a [f**king] evil whore you really are, another user wrote to them in a private Facebook message. Another Facebook user was more succinct.  Please die, the user wrote in a private message.  A lot of them come from the position that they have children that were vaccine-injured, Catherine said. But a fair chunk of them are just haters.  Grieving mothers aren't the only targets of anti-vaxer abuse.  Dorit Reiss, a professor at UC Hastings School of Law, has received countless vile messages, and as with the mothers, many of the messages are gender-oriented. Over the years, she's become pretty blas\u00e9 about it.  'Whore' is pretty normal, said Reiss, a pro-vaccine advocate who has written extensively about vaccines. I've also been called a [c**t]. Sometimes Reiss, who is Jewish, receives comments that mention the Holocaust.  One Facebook user made a meme with a photo of her father with Proud Supporter of the Vaccine Holocaust. Reiss says her father has nothing to do with vaccines.  Another meme shows a photo of Reiss holding her infant son and it says that Reiss is FORCE-injecting her baby with vaccines.  Below the photo is written: Because one holocaust wasn't enough.  Other Facebook users have said her children look sick in photos, and that vaccines are clearly to blame.  The Boy [sic] appears lethargic, one user wrote, with dark circles under his eyes. These are common precipitants of vaccine induced immune damage and suppression, as well as vaccine induced transient ischemic adverse event.  Of all the various messages from anti-vaxers, Reiss said the one that angered her the most was a voicemail left for her husband on his work phone.  If I hear or see anything written by your wife after today, I will release your phone number, your work phone number, your work address, her work address, her work phone number, the caller said, correctly reciting their phone numbers and home address.Three pediatricians who are vocal vaccine advocates have also been frequent targets of anti-vaxers. All three now have security escorts when they speak publicly.  Dr. Paul Offit keeps a fat folder of nasty messages he's received so that if someone kills me, my wife can give it to the police. He does not laugh when he says this.  Rot in hell you baby killer, one user wrote in an email to Offit, who is director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and professor of pediatrics at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania.   Go [f**king] kill yourself, another wrote.  Dr. Peter Hotez at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston is a vaccine researcher who wrote a book about his daughter called .  You have no morals whatsoever and you know that you are a [f**king] liar. I hope you rot in hell, one anti-vaxer emailed Hotez, a professor of pediatrics and dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor.  Users on the social media platform MeWe discussed an upcoming public meeting Hotez was expected to attend.  Maybe if we cause him enough stress he'll have a heart attack before [Wednesday], one woman wrote, adding, #sorrynotsorry.  Dr. Richard Pan, a pediatrician and a California state senator, spearheaded a successful attempt to get rid of vaccine exemptions for personal or religious reasons for schoolchildren in his state. He's frequently been the target of race-driven abuse by anti-vaxers on Facebook.  He says he's received thousands of hateful messages from anti-vaxers.   Chinese garbage, one user wrote on Pan's Facebook page, followed by vomiting and devil emojis. Most ignorant [a**hole].    I hope they stone you to death, another Facebook user wrote. I'll make a special trip to happily watch your head crack. The parents of the children you are destroying should each get a chance. Like a nazi pi\u00f1ata.  Some of the professionals and the mothers interviewed for this story said they reported the abusive messages they received to Facebook. Most of those who made reports said they received an automated response and in the end nothing changed. Others said after they made a report the sender was suspended from Facebook for a short period of time, or their offensive messages were removed.  Others said they didn't report to Facebook because the process was onerous or they'd heard that it wouldn't change anything.  A Facebook spokesperson responded to these concerns:  We try to empower our users with controls, such as blocking other users and moderating comments, so they can limit their exposure to unwanted, offensive or hurtful content. We also encourage people to report bullying behavior on our platform, so we can review the content and take proper action, the spokesperson wrote in an email. We want members of our community to feel safe and respected on Facebook and will remove material that appears to purposefully target private individuals with the intention of degrading or shaming them.   Erin Costello, a former bartender and current stay-at-home mom in Utica, New York, is the Ron who texted the grieving mother in the Midwest, warning her to expect more anti-vaxer attacks. Costello is an administrator for the pro-vaccine Facebook page   Costello is one of several vaccine advocates who've set up so-called sock puppet or fake Facebook accounts and then joins the closed anti-vaxer groups to spy on them.  She said she often sees members discussing posts by parents of sick or dead children, sometimes suggesting that members educate those parents by posting on their page.  For example, a member of the anti-vaccine group Stop Mandatory Vaccination said a mother had posted that her baby had suffered seizures after receiving vaccines. The anti-vaxer urged others in the group to comment for her to read! I want to win this mom over and she really trusts her pediatrician but at the same time she is scared!  Another member of Stop Mandatory Vaccination re-posted a post by Catherine Hughes, the mother who'd lost her child to a vaccine-preventable disease, calling for others to vaccinate their children.  Anyone want to chime in on this post? the anti-vaxer wrote.  Another member responded, I feel sorry for the lost baby and her other children but someone needs to inject her with vaccines until she dies.  When she sees anti-vaxers talking about parents in their closed groups, Costello, the online pro-vaccine spy, gets in touch with those parents to warn them they may be getting nasty messages from the anti-vaxers.  When Costello reached out to the mother in the Midwest, she explained why she was contacting her.  I know you're likely getting many horrible messages on Facebook right now, Costello wrote to the mother. Children such as [yours] are the reason why I do my part to fight for overwhelming acceptance of vaccines as well as fight against the lies and misinformation that are recklessly spread around against vaccines.  The mother wrote back.  I appreciate the strong role you take in helping protect families like mine, she said.  After hundreds of Facebook comments from anti-vaxers, the mother turned off comments on her page, and deleted many of the ones she received.  Some are still in her head, though. She weeps as she remembers the one that was hardest to read.  The ones that said this was a fake story. That he wasn't real. That my child didn't exist, she said. Because when your child dies, that's the biggest fear -- that he will be forgotten.  CNN's Denise Powell contributed to this story. "},

It can be especially serious for babies, pregnant women and people with weakened immune systems.Bevin's remarks come several days after a teen in Kentucky which had temporarily barred students who aren't immunized against chickenpox from attending school after an outbreak at a Catholic school. There have been 32 cases of chickenpox reported.  The teen and his father allege that he's being discriminated against because of religious beliefs. Some Catholics worry about vaccines derived from cell lines associated with abortion.The Northern Kentucky Health Department argued the ban was an appropriate and necessary response to prevent further spread of this contagious illness.Chickenpox has not gone away since the vaccine was introduced in the United States in 1995, but each year, more than 3.5 million cases are prevented by the chickenpox vaccination, the CDC said.Initially, only one dose of the vaccine was recommended for children. But when experts realized that a small percentage of children didn't mount robust immunity after the first dose, the recommendations were changed. Two doses are currently recommended: one at 1 year of age and a second around 4. The two-dose vaccination program has resulted in a smaller number of outbreaks, according to the CDC.CNN's Madison Park contributed to this report."},

He does not laugh when he says this.Rot in hell you baby killer, one Facebook user wrote in an email to Offit, who is director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and professor of pediatrics at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania.Go [f**king] kill yourself, another wrote.Dr. Peter Hotez at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston is a vaccine researcher and pediatrician who wrote a book about his daughter called Vaccines did not Cause Rachel's Autism.You have no morals whatsoever and you know that you are a [f**king] liar. I hope you rot in hell, one anti-vaxer emailed Hotez, a professor of pediatrics and dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor.A  published on Tuesday revealed such online attacks have become a growing part of the online vaccination debate.Yet it turns out that the anti-vax sentiments frequently made on Facebook tend to remain consistent in their messaging and arguments -- but are diverse, as they often fit within four distinct subgroups, according to a study  on Thursday.Those subgroups are: distrust of the medical community and public health officials; questions about the content of vaccines and whether there are alternative options for immunity; concerns about the safety of vaccines and their effectiveness; and conspiracy theories, such as views that the poliovirus does not exist, according to the study.The study was inspired by Kids Plus Pediatrics, an independent pediatric care practice in Pittsburgh, which  in August 2017 about how it offers the human papillomavirus vaccine. About a month after the video was posted, anti-vaccination comments appeared in response to the video. The comments were so inflammatory that, in the new study, researchers decided to take a closer look and analyze the accounts behind the comments.Some of the comments claimed the HPV vaccine kills people, and that the pediatric practice should stop seeing patients, given their vaccine promotion efforts, said Beth Hoffman, a graduate student at the University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public Health and a researcher with the university's Center for Research on Media Technology and Health, who was first author of the study.There's been some previous work looking at the content of anti-vaccine messages within Facebook groups and then more broadly on the internet. ... But no one yet has done what we did in this paper, looking at the individual profile pages and actual people, Hoffman said.One thing that is important to be thinking about is these anti-vaccine messages are spreading rapidly, she said. These very vocal anti-vaxers are extreme, but we have this full spectrum of people who are vaccine hesitant. They are now being exposed to all this information on social media that can be very persuasive.The study included data on 197 individual Facebook accounts among those that made anti-vax comments on the HPV vaccine video posted by Kids Plus Pediatrics on Facebook in 2017. The researchers assessed publicly available content made by each account on the social media platform.The researchers found that the majority of the accounts, 89%, identified as women and, among those who divulged their location, the accounts represented 36 states and eight other countries. While anti-vaccination posts on the accounts' Facebook profile pages were diverse, the content tended to cluster into four distinct subgroups relating to trust, alternative options, safety, and conspiracies.Individuals from around the globe who are opposed to vaccination are connecting via social media, suggesting the need for clinicians and researchers to develop interventions to combat the propagation of misinformation about vaccines on social media, the researchers wrote in the study.The study had some limitations, including that the sample of Facebook accounts in the research does not necessarily reflect the entire anti-vax community online, and more research is needed to determine whether similar findings would emerge among a larger sample.We only looked at a portion of people who responded to a pro-vaccine video, Hoffman said. It would be important to look at more people.The data in the study also only involved publicly available content from Facebook. We didn't go in and friend these people and see what they were sharing, Hoffman said.Overall, the study confirms that Facebook is an element of the anti-vaccine movement, which is now first and foremost its own media empire with , said Hotez, who was not involved in the new research.The study confirms that Facebook is now a key disseminator for those misinformation websites, he said.Facebook announced earlier this month that it plans to  in its news feed and search options by lowering the ranking of groups and pages that make false claims on its platform.However, Hotez said the social media giant could do more, such as removing groups and pages that spread misinformation. Some people argue that doing so would be a First Amendment violation. Facebook and  are not the US government, they're private entities, Hotez said in response. They're a leading source of misinformation that is putting children in harms' way.Most health care professionals have argued that spreading misinformation about vaccines is harmful because  against  -- such as polio, tetanus, the flu, whooping cough and measles -- so not getting vaccinated can put a person at risk of such illnesses.When considering this important role that vaccines play in public health, the name-calling and shaming used online in  can be unproductive, said Dr. Edith Bracho-Sanchez, a practicing pediatrician and a Stanford and CNN Global Health and Media Fellow.I, like many of my colleagues, have been called cynical, a hypocrite, a liar, accused of being part of conspiracy, of profiting from vaccines, and -- in the best of cases -- told I'm just ignorant and unaware, said Bracho-Sanchez, who was not involved in the new study. I don't engage with the individuals who target me in this way because I believe they are looking to insult and be inflammatory rather than to start a conversation, she said.

{"title": "Chickenpox parties and natural immunity: Your questions answered", "cate": "health", "content": "Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin recently said he chose to  instead of giving them the vaccine.They had it as children. They were miserable for a few days, and they all turned out fine, Bevin said in an interview with WKCT, a Bowling Green, Kentucky, radio station.So-called chickenpox parties, in which parents expose their kids to the disease based on the belief that it will be more serious if contracted as an adult, are not a new concept. Before vaccines became available, the parties used to be very popular for diseases such as chickenpox or measles. Although these parties are far less common now, parents will still occasionally advertise having a child with chickenpox at home, inviting other parents with small children to come get it over it and develop lifelong immunity.No, they really are not a good idea at all. Chickenpox parties were an OK idea in the days when parents had no other way to build long-lasting immunity in their children. But since the introduction of the chickenpox vaccine in 1995, parents no longer need to go to these extremes. They have a much safer way to make sure their kids are protected for years to come.  Two doses of the vaccine, given at ages 12 months through 15 months and then again at 4 through 6 years, are about 90% effective at preventing chickenpox.In the small number of people who still get chickenpox despite having received the vaccine, the illness is usually milder, with fewer or no blisters and a mild fever, or sometimes no fever at all, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Developing immunity to an infectious disease like the chickenpox means the immune system has seen the virus, has mounted a response, and has developed what's called memory to the particular illness. This immune system memory will allow it to react faster the next time it encounters a virus like the chickenpox, protecting the person against the infection.  The immune system does not care how the body was exposed to the illness. Whether this happened through one full blown infection such as that acquired at a chickenpox party, or after several doses of a vaccine, immunity is immunity. In the long run, the difference comes in days feeling miserable, like Bevin admitted his children felt; in days missed from school and work; and in the small but very real number of severe and potentially fatal complications that come from acquiring an illness like the chickenpox.Many of us did. Again, our parents had no better way to protect us against the chickenpox, and it is true that the illness can be more severe in adulthood. But although many still think of the chickenpox as a mild, no-big-deal childhood illness, the truth is that this very contagious infectious disease can go beyond the rash, itchiness and fever. Before the vaccine was introduced in the United States in 1995, chickenpox used to affect 4 million people every year. Among those, 8,000 to 18,000 were hospitalized, and 100 to 150 died every year. In 2017, the number of total cases was down to 8,775, according to the . Chickenpox can be more serious in pregnant women and children under age 1. The vaccine is not indicated for either of these groups, hence the importance of everyone else being vaccinated and stopping the spread of this illness. The  also explains that complications from the chickenpox include bacterial superinfections of the skin, blisters, pneumonia, and extension of the infection to the central nervous system -- in addition to hospitalization and death. The short answer to the shingles question is this: indicates that those who receive the chickenpox vaccine have a lower risk of developing shingles later in life than those who had the chickenpox itself.Shingles, also known as herpes zoster, is a skin disorder triggered by the chickenpox or varicella virus. It can remain dormant along nerve roots after someone gets the chickenpox and reactivate later in life. Vaccination against shingles is recommended for all adults 50 and older in the United States.

It has been shown in clinical trials to work within hours to treat the symptoms of , a serious mental illness that impacts 1 in 9 new mothers after childbirth. Postpartum depression is a serious condition that, when severe, can be life-threatening. Women may experience thoughts about harming themselves or harming their child. Postpartum depression can also interfere with the maternal-infant bond. This approval marks the first time a drug has been specifically approved to treat postpartum depression, providing an important new treatment option, Dr. Tiffany Farchione, acting director of the Division of Psychiatry Products in the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said in a  on Tuesday.Because of concerns about serious risks, including excessive sedation or sudden loss of consciousness during administration, Zulresso has been approved with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) and is only available to patients through a restricted distribution program at certified health care facilities where the health care provider can carefully monitor the patient, she said.The treatment is administered as a single 60-hour IV drip and was found to have mild side effects, such as headache, dizziness or excessive sleepiness, but also sudden loss of consciousness. Yet some women may face barriers accessing this type of treatment, as it requires 60 hours of time. The drug will likely be priced around $20,000 to $35,000 per treatment, , the company that developed the drug, confirmed.The initial list price for Zulresso in the United States will be $7,450 per vial, resulting in a projected average course of therapy cost of $34,000 per patient before discounts, according to the company. The actual number of vials used before discounts can vary from patient to patient.The medication will be available in June, said Dr. Jeff Jonas, CEO of the Massachusetts-based biopharmaceutical company that developed the drug. The drug will be available only through a restricted program called the Zulresso Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) Program that requires the drug be administered by a health care provider in a certified health care facility,the FDA said in a  announcing the approval. There are no FDA approved antidepressants for postpartum depression, so approval of the first medication of its kind is a breakthrough for patients, said Dr. Kristina Deligiannidis, the director of Women's Behavioral Health at Northwell Health's Zucker Hillside Hospital in New York, who was involved in two of the drug's clinical trials as a researcher. Without any treatment, postpartum depression can last for months or even years, according to the . Studies showed the brexanolone was effective regardless of when postpartum depression symptoms began. In the United States, it's estimated that every year, more than  to mothers who are depressed. Treatment options for postpartum depression have included counseling or therapy with a mental health professional and antidepressant medications, but no antidepressant medication has been specifically FDA-approved to treat postpartum depression. Also,  generally don't provide an immediate relief of symptoms and may take several weeks to help.Brexanolone in phase II and III trials demonstrated rapid antidepressant effects, said Deligiannidis, who is also an associate professor at the  and member of the Anxiety and Depression Association of America.Those effects are something that Stephanie Hathaway, a Connecticut-based mother of two, knows well.When Hathaway brought her first baby home from the hospital, she was just as excited and nervous as most new moms -- but she also experienced crying spells and troubling thoughts that she couldn't shake.The first two weeks I was crying excessively, Hathaway said. At first, her husband and she thought her tears were from the baby blues, a feeling of sadness or emptiness after giving birth that goes away within a few days.But after that I had intrusive thoughts, she said. Those were, 'Your daughter deserves a better mom,' and 'Your husband deserves a better wife.' Then Hathaway knew she needed help when one day she was holding her daughter and she feared what she might do to herself once she put her baby down. That year, in 2014, Hathaway was diagnosed with postpartum depression and was treated with traditional antidepressant medications, which she said helped over time.A few years later, in 2017, Hathaway had a second child, and was prescribed the same antidepressants during that pregnancy -- but the medications were not helpful in relieving her symptoms.A friend told Hathaway about clinical trials being conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of brexanolone in treating postpartum depression. Hathaway enrolled in a trial.It was a 60-hour infusion and in the first 12 to 18 hours I felt the biggest difference, Hathaway said. Those intrusive thoughts that played on repeat in my head, those went away and didn't come back, she said, adding that as a side effect, I just had one very small instance of standing up and feeling lightheaded.In 2016, the  a breakthrough therapy designation for the treatment of postpartum depression. Such a designation is intended to expedite the development and review of drugs for serious or life-threatening conditions.Results from two phase III trials of brexanolone, conducted across 30 clinical research centers and specialized psychiatric units in the United States, published in the journal  in August. The trials, conducted in 2016 and 2017, involved more than 200 women who had symptoms of postpartum depression, which were assessed by standardized research scales. The women were followed up with over 30 days. Sage Therapeutics funded the research. In those studies, some of the women were given 60-hour IV infusions of smaller or larger doses of brexanolone while others were given a placebo. The researchers found that the women who received brexanolone infusions had significant and clinically meaningful reductions in their depression scores. In the first study, by the end of 60 hours, the average reduction was 19.5 points in the brexanolone group that received smaller doses, and 17.7 points in the brexanolone group that received larger doses, compared with 14 points in the placebo group.In the second study, which had only one brexanolone group, the average reduction in score was by 14.6 points in the brexanolone group compared with 12.1 points in the placebo group at 60 hours, the researchers found.Overall, at 60 hours, about 75% of women who received brexanolone were at least 50% improved in their symptoms and about half of women who received brexanolone were no longer clinically depressed, Deligiannidis said.Among the patients who had a response at 60 hours, 94% did not relapse at the 30-day followup.The most common side effects included headache among 15.7% of patients; dizziness among 13.6%; and somnolence or excessive sleepiness among 10.7%, the researchers found.The researchers wrote in the study that their findings provide strong evidence for the efficacy and safety of brexanolone injection in women with moderate to severe post-partum depression.Limitations of the studies include that the women were followed only for 30 days, so the duration of treatment effects beyond that were not included in the data.The treatment also requires 60 hours of an IV -- which, for women without support at home or living in poverty, could be difficult. Low-income mothers are at . The treatment also could interrupt breastfeeding, and patients are encouraged to discuss the risks and benefits of breastfeeding with their physician.Additionally in the trials, brexanolone had the most robust effects on women experiencing severe postpartum depression whereas results were more modest among others whose postpartum depression was less severe.What has been consistent is that brexanolone had a very robust response -- and what's been most exciting to me, in terms of participating in this new drug development, was the rapid onset of response. The drug works quickly, said Dr. Samantha Meltzer-Brody, a professor of mood and anxiety disorders at the  in Chapel Hill, who was a researcher in those phase III trials for the drug.My greatest hope is that this increases awareness. What's heartbreaking is the number of women who suffer in silence and do not get the treatment that they need, she said. People need to reach out and get screened and get treatment, regardless of if treatment is with brexanolone or not.The clinical data supporting the effectiveness of brexanolone in helping women recover from postpartum depression sheds new light on the neurobiology of the illness, as well as depression during other life periods, said Catherine Monk, professor of medical psychology in obstetrics and gynecology and psychiatry at  and director of research in the women's program in psychiatry at NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center in New York. Monk was not involved in the drug trials.Monk, who is also a research scientist at the New York State Psychiatric Institute, added that because its effects are truly expedited, within days, it potentially sets a new standard for treatment for severe postpartum depression."},
{"title": "Car crash ER visits fell in states that ban texting while driving, study says", "cate": "health", "content": "States with bans on texting while driving saw an average 4% reduction in emergency department visits after motor vehicle crashes, an equivalent of 1,632 traffic-related emergency department visits per year, according to a new analysis.Researchers examined emergency department data across 16 US states between 2007 and 2014. The states were picked based on the availability of information regarding motor vehicle accident injuries for which emergency department treatment was needed. In the United States, 47 out of 50 states currently have laws restricting texting while driving. Of the 16 states researchers looked at in the study, all but one (Arizona) had one of these laws. Texting-while-driving bans are either primary laws, meaning drivers can be pulled over for texting regardless of whether another traffic violation took place, or secondary laws, in which drivers are sanctioned for texting only after another violation like speeding or running a red light took place. Some states implement the bans on all drivers, while others sanction only new drivers. The states that had texting bans, regardless of the type or who it applied to, saw a 4% average reduction in emergency department visits, according to the results published Thursday in the . The states that chose to implement primary bans on all drivers saw an 8% reduction in crash-related injuries. Drivers of all ages, even those older 65, who are typically not known for texting while driving, saw reductions in the number of injuries following crashes. Alva Ferdinand, lead author of the study, a lawyer, and an assistant professor of health policy at the School of Public Health at Texas A&M University, explained her research has always focused on whether the laws that people consider punitive can have an impact on health.  The law can be a very useful public health intervention. There are lives that can be saved and injuries prevented as a result of these laws, said Ferdinand.  In 2016, nearly 3,500 people lost their lives and 391,000 were injured but survived a crash related to distracted driving, including texting, according to data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.  Previous studies had not shown a benefit for laws that sanction drivers for texting only after another violation has taken place. These studies, however, have mainly examined whether there is a reduction in the number of deaths, the authors explain. Injuries are a much more likely outcome, they argue, and therefore, they're important to study and consider in public health efforts. Ferdinand explained the study has two main limitations. It did not measure how well laws are implemented in different states and, perhaps most importantly, it did not include all 50 states. Despite its limitations, Ferdinand is confident the same trends are true around the country. "},

{"title": "Physician groups call for taxes and regulations on kids' access to sugary drinks", "cate": "health", "content": "Physicians' groups have long taken a stand against high consumption of sugary drinks in the United States -- and now they are calling for several policies to limit access to sugar-sweetened beverages among children and teens.The American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Heart Association  on Monday targeted at federal, state and local lawmakers, encouraging them to implement policies that would reduce children's intake of sugary drinks, such as sodas, sports drinks and juice. The policy statement is the first time AAP has recommended taxes on sugary drinks, it said.I talk with my patients and their families all the time about the health harms of sugary drinks and the advantage of drinking primarily water and milk. But still, sugary drinks are a mainstay in many children's diets. They are inexpensive, easy to find, heavily marketed, and taste sweet, so children like them, said Dr. Natalie Muth, a  in Carlsbad, California, who was lead author of the policy statement, published in the journal Pediatrics.At the same time, pediatricians are diagnosing type 2 diabetes, fatty liver disease, and high cholesterol in our young patients. These are health problems that we rarely saw in children in the past. These are health problems associated with high sugar intake, Muth said.We have tried, and failed, to curb sugary drink intake through education and individual choices alone, she said. Just like policy changes were necessary and effective in reducing consumption of tobacco and alcohol, we need policy changes that will help reduce sugary drink consumption in children and adolescents.The policy statement specifically calls for: Out of all of those policy recommendations, Muth said that a sugary drink excise tax has the greatest evidence and precedent to be most impactful.We know that an increase in price leads to a decrease in consumption, she said. We know from the examples of communities where a sugary tax has already been implemented, such as Mexico and .In response to the policy statement, America's beverage companies believe there's a better way to help reduce the amount of sugar consumers get from beverages and it includes putting parents in the driver's seat to decide what's best for their children, William Dermody, a spokesperson for the , which represents the non-alcoholic beverage industry, said in a statement.The association argues that beverages are not unique drivers of obesity rates and obesity-related diseases in the United States, as obesity rates have been rising while soda consumption rates have been declining.We are supporting parents who want less sugar in their kids' diets by creating more drinks than ever before with less or no sugar, as well as smaller portion sizes, and by backing efforts to make water, milk or 100 percent juice the default beverages restaurants serve with children's meals, he added. Today, 50 percent of all beverages sold contain zero sugar as we drive toward a goal of reducing beverage calories consumed by 20 percent by 2025.Efforts to make water or milk default beverages served on children's menus were among the policy recommendations put forth in the new policy statement from the American Academy of Pediatrics and American Heart Association. The new policy statement comes on the heels of a separate study, published last week in , which found a positive association between the long-term consumption of sugary drinks and premature death in adults in the United States.Most of my work has focused on adults and we have shown that, in addition to weight gain, regular consumption of sugary beverages is associated with higher risk of type 2 diabetes, heart disease, stroke, hypertension, some cancers and premature death, said Vasanti Malik, a research scientist in the 's Department of Nutrition, who was not involved in the new policy statement but led that separate study.She also praised the new policy statement.I thought the joint statement provided a good summary of some key policy strategies to support a reduction in intake of sugary drinks for children and adults, Malik said about the policy statement. The reason for this call to action is because of the strong and consistent evidence linking intake of sugary beverages to adverse health outcomes."},

Using two national insurance claim databases, the authors followed 221,486 teens and young adults ages 13 to 25 with ADHD who were prescribed a stimulant for the first time between the years 2004 and 2015. Half received amphetamines such as Adderall and half received methylphenidates such as Ritalin. A total of 343 of the teens and young adults who were followed -- or one out of every 660 young people -- developed an episode of psychosis in the few months after starting on a stimulant. The risk for this rare but serious side effect was twice as high -- 0.21% -- for those taking amphetamine, compared to 0.1% for those taking methylphenidate, according to the results published Wednesday in the . We've seen cases of people coming in without much of a psychiatric history who are developing this sort of first episode of psychosis in the setting of stimulant use, most commonly Adderall, said Dr. Lauren Moran, assistant professor at Harvard Medical School, practicing psychiatrist at McLean Hospital, and lead author of the study. Moran said her observations caring for young people experiencing psychosis prompted the research. ADHD is a developmental disorder, and its symptoms include inattention, hyperactivity, and restlessness or impulsivity that is more severe, frequent or debilitating than normal. Stimulants have been shown to be effective in controlling these symptoms. Since 2007 the US Food and Drug Administration has required manufacturers to add a warning to drug labels, stating stimulants may cause treatment-emergent psychotic or manic symptoms in patients with no prior history.Current guidelines recommend either methylphenidate or amphetamine as first line treatment of ADHD when a medication is required. Teens and young adults were four times more likely to receive a prescription for amphetamine such as Adderall in 2015 compared to 2004, and 1.6 times more likely to receive one for methylphenidates such as Ritalin, according to the new research. There are subtle differences in the way Adderall and Ritalin affect dopamine systems in the brain, Moran said. Both stimulants work through dopamine pathways in the brain, but Adderall is more likely to cause a release of dopamine, whereas Ritalin is more likely to block the re-uptake, allowing it to linger. The surge of dopamine during a psychotic episode most closely mimics that seen after stimulant use like Adderall, which may explain some of the findings, Moran added. Dr. Rebecca Baum, a developmental and behavioral pediatrician at Nationwide Children's Hospital in Ohio who was not involved in the study, says she worries the results may alarm parents and scare them away from effective treatments for their children. Any time we use a medication we are certainly thinking about what is the benefit of the medication versus the risk, said Baum, stressing that ADHD can be a debilitating condition when symptoms aren't well-controlled, and while psychosis is a real and potentially serious side effect, it is still very rare.   The vast majority of my patients have ADHD and I have the benefit of being able to treat many patients quite successfully, said Baum. Thankfully in my practice it is not a side effect that we see very often, she added.Moran also adds that she and her team focused the study on teens and young adults who were taking stimulants for the first time, emphasizing that for those who have been on these medications and have been taking them as prescribed, the risk is likely even lower. As for parents and young adults weighing whether to start a medication, Moran hopes the research will prompt a conversation about risks, benefits and alternatives such as behavioral therapy and non-stimulants."},

Here's who it's killing", "cate": "health", "content": "Deaths from the synthetic opioid fentanyl skyrocketed more than 1,000% from 2011 to 2016, according to a  released Thursday.The number of fatalities related to the drug held fairly steady between 2011 and 2012, hovering around 1,600 deaths in both those years. In 2013, the number increased to just over 1,900 fatalities. Beginning in 2014, though, fentanyl-related deaths began to double each year. In 2014, fentanyl was involved in 4,223 deaths. In 2015, it was 8,251 deaths. And in 2016, fentanyl-related deaths had jumped to 18,335. The report from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also analyzed who had been hardest hit by the fentanyl epidemic. The researchers, who are part of the National Center for Health Statistics, found that while men and women had similar rates of fentanyl-related deaths from 2011 through 2013, that began to shift. By 2016, the rate of men dying from fentanyl overdoses was nearly three times that of women. And while there were increases in fentanyl-related fatalities in all age groups, the largest rate increases were among younger adults between the ages of 15 and 34. The rate of 15- to 24-year-olds who died from fentanyl overdoses increased about 94% each year between 2011 and 2016, and about 100% each year for 25- to 34-year-olds.Researchers also found that while whites had the highest overall rates of fentanyl fatalities, death rates among blacks and Hispanics were growing faster. Between 2011 and 2016, blacks had fentanyl death rates increase 140.6% annually and Hispanics had an increase of 118.3% annually. A National Center for Health Statistics report  found fentanyl to be the drug mostly commonly involved in overdose deaths.

Researchers analyzed death certificate information that included mentions of fentanyl and fentanyl analogs. Previous analysis had not looked specifically only at fentanyl, but overall synthetic opioids. Americans are now more likely to die from a drug overdose than a car accident. In 2017, drug overdoses killed more than , and opioids are the leading driver in US drug overdose deaths.

{"title": "As GM's Lordstown plant idles, an iconic American job nears extinction", "cate": "business", "content": "When Felice Robinson was hired at General Motors' Lordstown plant in 1995, she thought the rest of her life was taken care of.Robinson, who was then in her mid-20s, had been bouncing around a series of low-paid retail jobs when she learned the giant factory down the road was hiring. The assembly line position came with generous health care benefits, an hourly wage more than twice what she had been making at a menswear store, and the promise of a secure retirement \u2014 if she could hold on to the job for 30 years.It was a whole different world, Robinson, who's now 50, told CNN Business in late February. I couldn't believe how lucky I was, to be making that kind of money without a college degree. That world has been evaporating for decades now. On Wednesday, when the Lordstown plant will make its last Chevy Cruze and close its doors, it will get even smaller. For GM, the move is part of an overall strategy to shift away from sedans and toward higher-margin trucks and light SUVs in an era of low gas prices. GM is also pouring money into electric and autonomous cars, which are still primarily in the research and development phase. And with GM's investment in a ridesharing platform called Maven, the company is looking forward to a future in which fewer people own vehicles at all. For workers, the transition means uncertainty, dislocation and immersion in a labor market with far fewer opportunities for those without training beyond a high school degree. As recently as the early 2000s, a job in an auto plant could be a launchpad to the middle class, but those jobs are increasingly rare. During the Lordstown plant's heyday in the 1970s, GM was one of the biggest private sector employers in the United States, with more than 618,000 employees. That number is now down to about 103,000. And the jobs that remain are not all what they once were. Since 1990, wages for US auto workers have declined 18%, adjusted for inflation. Retirement benefits have declined as well. As of 2017, only .Those trends are especially pronounced in the Youngstown, Ohio region, an area about halfway between Cleveland and Pittsburgh in which Lordstown sits. Thirty years ago, about 1 out of 4 local workers were . Now, less than half that many are. Since the beginning of the Great Recession,  have dropped by 8% in the area, while rising 11% in the rest of the country. All that has made GM jobs stick out: Full-time production workers make between $61,000 and $88,000 a year after only a couple years on the job, according to their United Auto Workers union , not including additional overtime pay and bonuses. That's well above the average wage in the Youngstown area, which was around $38,000 in 2017. Unlike during the Great Recession, GM is cutting these jobs \u2014 along with about 1,400 more hourly positions at US plants elsewhere \u2014 at a time when it's profitable and the national economy is strong. That's an indication that GM sees its future as one with fewer factory-floor workers, not more of them. And for the Youngstown area, losing the last major supplier of the type of jobs that made it a manufacturing powerhouse decades ago is a particularly symbolic blow. About 400 of the 1,400 people who'll no longer go to work at GM's sprawling Lordstown complex after this week have accepted transfers to other plants, and will keep their healthcare and pensions. Other former workers at the plant, which used to run 24 hours a day, were not as fortunate. As demand for the Cruze weakened over the past two years, its second and third shifts were cut, and 3,000 people were laid off. Many of them won't be offered the same transfer opportunities this latest group will.GM says that 350 Lordstown workers are eligible for retirement, those who transfer will get $30,000 in relocation assistance, and that it's working to find new employment for anyone who wants it. We understand that the decision that was made is very difficult for this community because it impacts people and families, GM spokesman Daniel Flores told CNN Business. Unfortunately, customers are not buying the product at a volume that would justify continued production. In the end, we made this decision at a point in time where we have the ability to offer opportunities to people who want to keep working for GM.Robinson thinks she probably has enough seniority to get a placement at one of GM's other facilities, like the metal fabrication plant in Cleveland or the transmission factory in Toledo. She dreads transferring \u2014 she'll have to leave her 68-year-old aunt who needs support, as well as the rest of her family and friends, and the town she's always called home. But she has little choice: Despite the strongest US labor market in a generation, the economy is not generating the types of jobs that GM offered her as a young woman. At least not in Youngstown. They have me by a chokehold. There's nothing I can do, Robinson said. I make $32 an hour. I'm not going to go get a $12-an-hour job. I couldn't survive on that at all. I'm going to get up and go, ride it out, try to get the best gig I can get, and be done with them. The loss of General Motors won't be the first time the Youngstown area took a shock to the heart. It's been reeling ever since the sudden collapse of the local steel industry in the late 1970s, when competition from cheap imports \u2014 and the failure of American steel mills to compete \u2014 led to the disappearance of nearly 50,000 jobs over five years. Through that time, the auto industry became something of a lifeline. The Lordstown plant, which opened in 1966, hired thousands of workers, and thousands more worked in smaller, independent machine shops that supplied auto parts to GM. The GM plant floated the local government, providing some $2 million a year in tax revenue, said Terry Armstrong, superintendent of the Lordstown school district. The Lordstown school campus, with its spacious lecture halls and a planetarium, was built without debt.The unionized jobs paid far above market, topping out in the $30-an-hour range, for reasonably humane tasks like installing seatbelt harnesses, securing engine brakes or driving forklifts. Former GM worker Tom Albright, who retired in 2015, remembers being able to do his work faster than the rest of the line and then relax. I could get ahead of the job for three hours, and at that point I could go goof off for three hours, said Albright, whose son still works in the plant. Those were the good old days. It ain't like that anymore. They get every nickel that they can out of that individual working that job on the floor. But then cracks started to show in the US auto industry, starting with competition from Japanese automakers in the 1980s and continuing with NAFTA in 1994. Employment slid, as work was outsourced to lower-paying suppliers, including plants in Mexico. The Lordstown plant wasn't immune to the changes that have been affecting the workforce more broadly. In 2007, as the automakers were bleeding cash, the union accepted the creation of a lower wage tier for entry-level workers, meaning that they made 45% less per hour and got a 401(k) plan instead of a guaranteed pension. After GM's bankruptcy in 2009, workers told CNN Business, the job became harder, with management pressing for less downtime.Slowly but surely, they became less and less thoughtful about the people who worked for them, said Robinson. It's just not the same company that I used to work for. It's so much more cutthroat, and it's meaner. I know that the old GM is gone. But many in the community still recognize that those jobs feed families, donate to local charities and buy cars. They also generate other jobs: Since manufacturing brings in capital from outside the area rather than just recirculating it, each factory position is estimated to get three or four more people working in fields like healthcare, food service, retail and education. That's why, last fall, the United Auto Workers local 1112 and the region's chamber of commerce started the  campaign \u2014 a community effort to post signs, send letters and work with politicians to convince GM to build another product at the Lordstown plant. It was meant to mimic another push two decades ago when Lordstown was in competition with other cities to win another car model to replace the Chevy Cavalier. That one worked, with the help of officials at the plant who joined the effort. The one difference is that this time plant management was not interested in participating, said James Dignan, president of the Youngstown/Warren Regional Chamber. The plant management used to be very engaged locally. But they're losing some of that tie and that feel from the company to the community.  Dignan said they're working to get another user for the plant if GM decides to give it up permanently.  But to the local union workers, getting another GM product is far preferable to getting another company. These are their jobs, and they'll likely still have more protections and higher wages than any other employer.We don't want Elon Musk coming in. We don't want Amazon building a distribution center, said David Green, who's been president of UAW Local 1112 since last May. He led another local within the plant in 2007 when the company asked to pay new workers lower wages. I supported that because the promise was product and job security, Green said. Do what we had to do to keep working, keep our communities and our families alive and thriving. It feels like they betrayed us a little bit.So far, the company hasn't shown its cards \u2014 and the uncertainty is what gets to people. Why take a transfer, if it seems likely that Lordstown will get a new car within the next year and you could come back? For that matter, what new employer would take a chance on someone who would bail as soon as Lordstown re-opened? Plenty of people remember how GM re-opened its plant in Spring Hill, Tennessee in 2011 after having  it two years earlier.That's why, for those who have the option, the choice of whether to go or stay is so agonizing \u2014 even though the job had its fair share of hardships.Tammy Vennitti, 55, was laid off with the second shift back in June last year. She had signed up for a training course in order to keep her supplemental unemployment benefits, and then put those plans on hold in January when GM called back those who'd been laid off to fill in for the people who were being moved out to other plants. Vennitti applied for a transfer to a plant in Toledo, and she doesn't know if she'll get it or whether she'd take it if she did, given that she lives with her 27-year-old daughter and 18-month-old granddaughter. But she needs the healthcare benefits to pay for the blood pressure pills her doctor put her on during the stress of being laid off for months, not to mention care for a body that took a beating over 24 years of lifting 30 to 40 pounds, 400 times a day. GM's gold-plated insurance paid for a shoulder replacement, carpal tunnel surgery and cortizone shots for a knee that had no more cartilage to cushion her bones. For 24 years I've done nothing for this company and this union but bend over, Vennitti said. This is all I've ever done. I never thought it would come to this. What's next for employment in Youngstown? The local chamber of commerce said there are 13,000 job openings in the area. Team NEO, an economic development non-profit focused on Northeast Ohio, said there will be  in the coming years for workers in information technology, healthcare and manufacturing. But unlike the manufacturing jobs of the past, which usually did not require education beyond high school, 65% of those jobs will require a post-secondary credential by 2021, the group estimates. There are plenty of training opportunities, since GM workers get assistance both from the state and the US Department of Commerce through trade adjustment assistance. So far, there's been strong interest in truck driving certificates, an Ohio state official said, since those take only a few weeks to get and pay relatively well.Some workers saw the end coming early and took steps to prepare. Trish Amato, 43, was hired too late to get a traditional pension, lessening the need to hang on to a GM job. She used GM's tuition benefits to finish her bachelor's degree and get a master's degree in special education. When she was laid off in 2018, Amato thought about going to the plant at Spring Hill, Tennessee. But she and her partner, whose truck driving job also depends on Lordstown being open, didn't think they could afford the rent in the booming area south of Nashville. So instead, they're thinking of trading in his big rig for a motorhome and traveling the country, while she teaches online courses from the road \u2014 a future that wouldn't have been possible without GM's help in going to school, and that she wouldn't have embraced without GM shuttering the Lordstown plant.GM is hard to walk away from because the insurance benefits are awesome, Amato said. GM gave us a good life. Am I disappointed in what they're doing? For other people, yes. For me, no. If something like this didn't happen, I wouldn't be able to follow a dream. For the next generation, the question is what kind of wages the new working class jobs will pay. The local high school has started a training program for the logistics industry, helping prepare kids for jobs in the many distribution centers that are popping up in the area. That's our way of giving kids a little bit of a leg up, said Armstrong, superintendent of the Lordstown school district, where about 15% of students have parents who worked in the plant.But, he said: I don't see them paying what the GM jobs paid. TJ Maxx, for example, is building a facility that will employ 1,000 people in the area.  for entry-level warehouse workers at its other locations range between $10 and $13.50 an hour.The GM plant had also been a regular stop for politicians on the stump, from John McCain to , giving kids a sense that their town mattered. On Tuesday, the school held a group photo to support the Drive it Home campaign; students and staff alike wore blue and brought their GM cars.But after this latest blow, will Lordstown students have confidence in a future in manufacturing? It would be really hard to convince many of them of that right now, with the plant closing, Armstrong said. They're able to make the cars of the future, we just have to make that chance available.

Trent Garner, who introduced the bill and is its lead sponsor, the measure seeks to curb Down syndrome discrimination by making it unlawful for a physician to perform -- or attempt to perform -- abortions solely based on a test indicating Down syndrome, a prenatal diagnosis, or any other reason to believe that an unborn child has the condition.I decided to push the bill forward to protect those that were born differently, Garner told CNN. Through the disastrous procedure of abortion, we lose valuable and special people from society.Under the proposed law, a physician would have to inform patients of the law, ask a pregnant woman if she is aware of test results, and request medical records. He or she is prohibited from performing the abortion for at least two weeks to obtain the records. There are caveats: a physician may go through with the procedure if the pregnancy puts the life of the mother or unborn child at harm, or if it is a result of rape or incest.If the measure becomes law, physicians who violate it would face a , which can be punishable by up to six years in prison, and his or her medical license would be revoked.

She was able to escape after her abductor dropped his keys.I jumped in front of a semi-truck, and I said 'My name's Midsi Sanchez, I've been kidnapped.'The harrowing kidnapping made headlines, but her recovery from the trauma was a personal nightmare. Sanchez was back at her Vallejo, California, school two weeks after her escape, inundated with questions from inquisitive classmates.  Despite active treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder, she struggled to process what happened to her and get back to normal. I couldn't relate to anybody, she added.Sanchez grew deeply depressed.  By the time she entered her teen years, she'd quit therapy and turned to drugs and alcohol to cope. She was addicted and out of control.I went from depression to anger, and then anger turned to fight and fighting turned into gangs, Sanchez recalled. I just was a hot mess of a teenager. Things got worse. In 2009, while riding in a car with a drunk driver, Sanchez was in a wreck. I ended up flying through a windshield at 80 mph breaking up pretty much every bone from my waist to my neck.Rushed to the hospital, the 16-year-old found out she was pregnant. I had a life-changing experience, and I knew I wanted to be different. Sanchez resumed therapy. She had a new resolve and was about to find a new mission.When Sanchez learned about another girl's abduction from the nearby town of Tracy, California, it hit close to home. She was 8 years old, Latina and from a family of five just like mine, Sanchez explained.I took that little girl's flyer home and had 3,000 copies printed.She also connected with the girl's family.

The hope is that the autonomous system will enable the airport to pack many more cars in the same amount of lot space.Gatwick Airport is the second-largest airport in the UK after London's Heathrow Airport.

{"title": "Amazon gets an edge with its secret squad of PhD economists", "cate": "business", "content": "Estimating inflation is a tricky and complex task. In the United States, the government's Bureau of Labor Statistics  to stores to record the price of everything from cheese to tires, and surveys consumers over the phone about what they spent on gas and funeral services.Amazon thinks it could do it better. With help from outside researchers, the company's economists are  to measure inflation using thousands of transactions across its own platform. Automatically analyzing product descriptions allows them to better assess the quality of a dress or a juicer or a bathmat, theoretically creating a more accurate, up-to-date index of how much things cost. That's just one way Amazon is using the squad of economists it has recruited in recent years. The company has turned so many businesses, from retailing to cloud computing, inside out. Now Amazon is upending the traditional role of economists within companies, as well as the field of economics. Amazon is now a large draw from the relatively small talent pool of PhD economists, which in the United States grows by about only 1,000 new graduates every year. Although the definition of economist is fuzzy, the discipline is  as the study of how people use resources and respond to incentives.In the past few years, Amazon has hired more than 150 PhD economists, making it probably the largest employer in the field behind institutions like the Federal Reserve, which has hundreds of economists on staff. It was the only company with a recruiting booth at the American Economics Association's annual conference in January, handing out free pens and logoed stress balls. Unlike economists in academia or government, the work of Amazon's economists is almost entirely secret, and staff are required to sign non-disclosure agreements to keep it that way. But according to background interviews and Amazon itself, integrating economists has been critical to the company's phenomenal growth in e-commerce. Amazon's economists game out real estate decisions, set the lowest prices that will deliver a profit, precisely determine what customers care about and whether advertisements are working \u2014 all using machine-learning algorithms that automate decisionmaking on a massive scale. It's the kind of asset that smaller companies can't always pay for, allowing Amazon to pull further and further away from the competition.Other tech companies that also make effective use of economists \u2014 like Uber, which has a 30-person team \u2014 speakwith frank admiration of the apparatus Amazon has built. Amazon is the only firm that has hired a lot of economists, let alone done it successfully, Uber's chief economist, Jonathan Hall, said in a speech to the American Economics Association in January. While many companies have hired economists as public-facing spokespeople or to guide general corporate strategy, Hall explained, both he and Amazon try to integrate them as key advisers on nearly every business decision, using enormous amounts of data to replace intuition with science.And in the meantime, Amazon is reshaping the economics field in its own image. The folks at Amazon and Uber are not doing the same sort of traditional chief economist's role, said Tom Beers, executive director of the National Association of Business Economics. They're doing something completely different.Economists are not new to private companies, where they've long helped forecast macroeconomic conditions to guide strategic decisions about what to produce, which markets to enter and where to source raw materials. They're not even new to the tech industry: Companies like IBM, Intel and Microsoft have had them for decades. Google's chief economist, Hal Varian,  the novel auction model for the company's IPO and also helped Google wasn't violating antitrust laws. Google now says it has about 300 economists and statisticians on staff, though it wouldn't give a more detailed breakdown. It is believed in the field that Amazon employs more PhD economists than any other tech company.In the past several years, a smattering of smaller consumer-facing tech companies \u2014 like the home-search platform Homeaway and the job website Indeed \u2014 have hired economists to crunch their user data and generate insights that can be packaged for journalists as a form of earned media. They also have a government relations function, generating analyses that quantify their company's positive impact on a particular community (and thereby arguing against regulation). Two years ago, the National Association of Business Economics started an just for tech economists, featuring remarks by four different Amazon economists and a reception sponsored by the company. The number of tech companies advertising for economists in the American Economics Association's job listings database has risen from 15 in the 2014 to 2015 academic year to 21 in 2017 to 2018, according to a  from Harvard Business School professor Michael Luca and Stanford GraduateBusiness School professor Susan Athey \u2014 a former economist at Microsoft. So far, the current year is on track to beat that number. And it's probably an undercount, given that not all tech companies advertise their economist postings there. In all of those places, the transformative element has been data, and the ability to analyze it using the tools of software engineers combined with the economist's expertise in asking questions about what causes what.  Imagine if you're a very large retailer that has a large number of locations, said Martin Fleming, chief economist at IBM. We could typically predict with about 30% to 40% accuracy what the likely performance is of that retail location. With the current capabilities with machine learning and artificial intelligence, we can get close to 90% accuracy in forecasting business at a particular location. That capability is perhaps most important to a company like Amazon, which has possibly more data than any other company \u2014 as well as a variety of lines of business that need data to operate, from lending to web services to last-mile delivery. The architect of Amazon's massive team of data crunchers is , and he's as respected an academic as they come. Since getting his PhD at the University of Minnesota in 1993, he has churned out papers on subjects like homeprices, government procurement, auctions and collusion. After working at Harvard, Stanford, and Duke, Bajari joined Amazon as a vice president and chief economist in 2010, and two years later took an appointment at the University of Washington. Amazon declined to make any of its economists available for interviews, or to answer questions on the record about their work. But the economistsoccasionally speak publicly, and Bajari appeared at the American Economics Association's conference to  about how big data affects firm performance, using Amazon's enormous trove of data and experiments on forecasting retail demand. After explaining the results, he shared some thoughts about how economics has shaped tech companies. What I've seen change in the industry, starting about eight years ago, is firms got more serious about using the scientific method and removing chunks of guesswork within companies, Bajari said, with a characteristic nervous laugh in between sentences. You're basically trying to clean up waste. At other companies, economists are often clustered in a small team, but at Amazon, they are integrated into many teams across the company. In a glossy recruiting brochure, Amazon describes how its economists help build risk models for lending to third-party sellers, advise on product design and engagement tracking for devices like Alexa and Kindle, help target customers for its booming cloud services business, and forecast server capacity needs for the consumer website. Among the  for economists on Amazon's hiring website, there are positions open for economists to help fine-tune seller pricing, figure out the best way to route trucks through Amazon's vast distribution network and identify the characteristics of top-performing talent in order to make the best hires.  For example, Amazon runs a program called Connections, which sends out small questionnairesto employees: Does your work provide you with opportunities to learn new things? Does your team always put the customer first? How often does bureaucracy get in the way of your ability to deliver results?To improve that feedback, Amazon tries out interventions like training managers to interact better with their subordinates. Originally, the company brought on a team of psychologists, other scientists and product managers, but before long, it became apparent that they weren't well suited to achieving what Amazon was ultimately after: Better performance. Economists, by contrast, were able to analyze which interventions led to higher worker productivity.The psychologists had a really hard time at Amazon, because they weren't trained in what economists are trained in, which is how this relates to profitability, said one former Amazon economist who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Amazon is a very data-driven place, and if you can't prove that your program is beneficial to customers, you're at risk of having your program defunded.A the root of figuring out whether an HR pilot program worked, and many other things economists do at Amazon, is something called causal inference: Determining what caused what, and therefore what to do more of and what to cut off. Take a Prime subscription, for example. Do consumers sign up mostly for the free shipping? The streaming video? Or the discounts at Whole Foods? Economists can come close to an answer, enabling the company to make better decisions about which benefits to include and which to scrap. Other decisions \u2014 like how to target ads, where to put bookstores and warehouses, and how much an Echo device should cost \u2014 are also vetted by economists. In most companies, that kind of work might be done by any data scientist. But according to another former Amazon economist, Bajari has advocated for hiring people with formal economics training to advise on as many business decisions as possible. They kind of make the point that economists have more specific skill sets that are better suited for a lot of business problems, the former Amazon staffer said. Because if you're writing an economics paper, you're studying things like the impact of the minimum wage, often without the luxury of running experiments. Building a team of 150 PhD economists is no easy task \u2014 not least because in graduate school, students learn that the private sector is a fallback option for people who couldn't land a job at a university. Corporate economists rarely publish in academic journals, which are the coin of the realm in academia. And unlike many fields in the humanities, economists can be paid well, especially at business schools. Amazon, of course, can pay better. Even rank-and-file economists make up to $160,000, which is where all Amazon employees top out in base salary, with stock options that make their total compensation a lot higher. However, that's not the main pitch Amazon makes to newly-minted PhDs. Its division leaders, many of whom came from tenured positions at top schools and have long lists of publications on their CVs, often write I'm hiring! in their LinkedIn profiles. Primarily, they advertise exclusive access to the mountains of data Amazon has at its disposal, which can be painstaking and time-consuming for researchers at universities to obtain. You should be agonizingly jealous of the sorts of problems we work on and the almost anxiety-provoking magnitude of data with which we get to work, wrote Wilko Schulz-Mahlendorf, a senior manager and economist who joined Amazon in 2013,. Now, it's the universities that are integrating machine learning and artificial intelligence into their curricula, knowing that they're essential skills for working with the kind of information now available and the biggest questions facing the economy today. For many academics, there's a downside to that: Private companies now create and control much of the raw material necessary to understand the modern world. Before, economists used to work on public data, said Beatrice Cherrier, an historian of economics at the University of Cergy Pontoise in France. And now, if they want to study behavior, the tech companies have it, and it's proprietary. Not only does that allow the Amazons of the world to not publish anything that might make them look bad, Cherrier explains \u2014 it also makes it difficult to replicate any studies that they might release, since the source data is under wraps. But for those on the inside, Amazon is a playground full of delights. Daryl Fairweather joined the company soon after receiving her PhD in economics from the University of Chicago in 2014. She was working for a consulting firm in San Diego, stressed out by deadlines on projects that she didn't find meaningful, when the Amazon option was suddenly everywhere. It wasn't like you had to go in and interview for just one job. You could interview for lots of jobs at the same time, said Fairweather, who left Amazon in 2018 to  for the real estate website Redfin. Once hired, research questions were everywhere. If I felt there was something really worth digging into, I could go dig into it. I wasn't told ahead of time what was important. The other big draw: Even though the work Amazon's economists do may never see the light of day, within the company, it influences decisions that affect millions of people. The most junior economists can present their research before senior vice presidents, and they're evaluated on how their recommendations impact the company's bottom line. That was personally really exciting. The work that I do has clear value that you can see right away \u2014 it's not just hypothetical, Fairweather said. When you publish in an academic journal, it's hard to know that lawmakers are making different choices based on what your results are. When you're in the company, it's very clear that you're changing peoples' minds.  "},

We are going to see a big advance in quality of life that 5G can deliver for individuals.For starters, there's the part it can play in your commute. Self-driving cars have been on the radar for a while, but with a 5G network they couldbecome reality. Industry players claim 5G can be  and that a huge number of devices will be able to connect to the network simultaneously. This will enable vehicles to talk to each other in real time: they'll know when another car is changing lanes or braking and can adjust to manage traffic accordingly. The BMW iNEXT, an electric SUV expected to come onto the market in 2021, is fitted with sensors that collect and process data from the car's surroundings. This car is permanently surveying the road around it and sending relevant bits of information up to the cloud, generating a true real-time map that in turn is pushed down to all the other cars, Christoph Grote, senior vice-president of electronics at BMW, tells CNN's Samuel Burke. The benefits of 5G do not stop there. The network could also have environmental impacts when used in smart agriculture.David Houghton, general manager of Asset Tracking Solutions at NimbeLink, tells CNN how 5G and the Internet of Things can help protect honeybees, and in turn the world's food supply.Beehives are valuable and as such they are in demand, so hive keepers need to protect them. So, they use asset trackers to essentially monitor the health of the hive, he says.  NimbeLink, in partnership with The Bee Corp, has developed a hive tracking and management system by which essential data such as temperature, humidity, movement and location is collected by sensors and can then be transmitted back for analysis. Of course, just as we get our heads around what 5G can do, scientists are already working on the next big thing.5G is good but 6G is better, says Ari Pouttu, a science professor at the University of Oulu, Finland. Expected to roll out in 2030, 6G will be a development beyond the smartphone. Let's throw the smartphones away and think about how humans interact with infrastructure, says Poutto.

It's a brutal fact of life for globe-trotting professionals, who often don't even have a full day to adjust before heading to workLuckily, there are ways to combat the brain-fogging exhaustion that accompanies jet lag, so you can work effectively wherever you've traveled. If you can, plan for the time change for trips by getting up and going to bed earlier several days prior to an eastward trip and later for a westward trip, says Natalie D. Dautovich, Ph.D., environmental scholar at the National Sleep Foundation and assistant professor of psychology at Virginia Commonwealth University.For short trips, consider sticking to your usual home sleep schedule if that's possible, advises Dautovich. For trips lasting three days or longer, set your watch, computer, Kindle, tablet or other electronics to your destination time at the outset. This will serve as a strong cue for the time change, says Dautovich. Travel is exhausting. The best way to reset is to arrive at your destination around bedtime. This way, no matter what time it is where you were, it is definitely bedtime where you are.  Try to arrive in the early evening and stay awake until 10 p.m. local time, advises Dautovich.Once it's daytime, optimize your light exposure to help adjust your body clock, she advises. For trips east, seek out bright light in the early morning hours and avoid bright light at night. When you go west, get light in the evening hours and avoid bright light in the morning, she adds.Your workout routine can help ease the transition. If your body thinks it's the middle of the night when you wake up, train it not to. FIght the fatigue and go for a morning run in the sun to jump start your body's adjustment to the new time zone. Just don't exercise too late in the day, which could make it harder to fall asleep at bedtime.Yes, it feels counterintuitive: Coffee, tea and sodas might help keep you awake, but they also dehydrate you and make it harder to fall asleep when you need to. Avoid caffeine altogether and you will be less tired in the long run. As for alcohol? A nightcap might seem like it could help put you to sleep (hence the name), but booze dehydrates. And dehydration is a major contributor to jet leg. Until you've adjusted to the new time zone, opt for good old-fashioned water instead.Many times the effects of jet lag cause travelers to wake up at 2 a.m. or 3 a.m., ready to start their day. Blot out hotel noises and lights with comfy ear plugs and eye masks, so you can avoid those unwanted too-early mornings."},

{"title": "Apple to join tech wave sweeping over Hollywood", "cate": "business", "content": "The history of Hollywood has been punctuated by infusions of new money and players looking to get into show business. Yet the latest wave of tech giants muscling in on the content game invites new questions about how studios will adapt -- and whether the new blood reflects a boon to them or an existential threat.On March 25,   will unveil its long-anticipated plans to take a bite out of the media content business. While entering that fray won't be cheap, it's a relative pittance for a company whose 2018 revenue totaled $265 billion, with a market capitalization in excess of $900 billion. Apple's ubiquitous devices represent their own kind of network, so why not own the content being funneled through them? The same goes for the millions of consumers who flock to Amazon each day, buying all manner of products, threatening the traditional retail model.Add Google's YouTube, Facebook Watch and existing streaming titan   into the mix, and the major studios would appear to be living on borrowed time. But when it comes to predicting their demise, close observers of Hollywood have seen that movie before.Most recently, those studios have become acquisition targets for distribution companies looking to funnel content through their pipelines.   absorbed NBCUniversal, while   more recently swallowed Time Warner, since renamed WarnerMedia, the parent company to CNN, HBO and Warner Bros.Before that, international companies bought up studios, at one point placing four of the then-seven majors in foreign hands. Indeed, a 1990 Los Angeles Times story captured the anxiety of that moment -- and seemingly foreshadowed this one -- with a sub-headline that read, Hollywood's Brave New World : A revolution in entertainment technology is coming, and the Japanese electronics giants buying up Hollywood are leading it.  still owns Columbia Pictures, while Universal has turned over three times to international entities -- first acquired by the Japanese company Matsushita, followed by the then-Canadian beverage company Seagram and the French water utility and media conglomerate Vivendi.In one respect the introduction of these tech players can represent a blessing. Given the need for programming to fuel distribution systems, studio libraries might possess new value as old means of generating revenue dry up, including the sale of reruns to TV stations.The understandable fear, though, is that companies the size of Apple,   and Netflix can bypass past conventions, launching their own production apparatus from scratch.The question, ultimately, is whether these companies will have both the know-how and commitment to that level of investment once they've had their noses bloodied by failure, an unavoidable byproduct of operating in the entertainment space.There's already been some trial and error. Amazon has sought to refine its theatrical release pattern, and pushed in 2017 to find a high-end series -- its own Game of Thrones -- as part of a  under CEO Jeff Bezos. YouTube, meanwhile, has , while seeking to find a balance in terms of episode lengths and budgets for its shows.Thus far, the clear beneficiaries of all this have been talent and their agents, as new players -- beginning with Netflix -- bid up the prices for big names. Netflix punctuated that point with for top producers Shonda Rhimes, Ryan Murphy and Kenya Barris, which studios fear will only drive up the cost of doing business.When Matsushita agreed to acquire Universal in 1990, Variety ran a headline in Japanese (without translation) that read, Buyer beware. The warning turned out to be rather prophetic, as then-Variety editor Peter Bart noted in  a decade later amid a new wave of overseas investment, writing, The Europeans have had as many problems as the Japanese in trying to get on Hollywood's wavelength.For their part, the studios are seeking to control their own destinies, which explains Disney's decision to bulk up through its acquisition of most Fox entertainment assets, which . Additional deal-making is almost sure to follow.It's too soon to clearly determine whether the tech giants will succeed or become the latest to discover that succeeding in show business -- however glamorous the industry might appear -- isn't as easy as it looks.If the latter proves true, they won't be the first deep-pocketed players to march into the content business with high hopes, only to realize that trying to get on Hollywood's wavelength can leave you with a case of bad vibrations."},
{"title": "Theranos employees struggle to put scandal behind them", "cate": "business", "content": "An endless job search compounded by fears of being blacklisted by certain businesses. Anxious gossip about who is and isn't mentioned in the latest news reports. And probing questions from outsiders on how they could ever have worked at the disgraced company. Welcome to life after Theranos.At its peak in 2014, the blood-testing startup was a darling of Silicon Valley. Theranos reportedly had a $9 billion valuation, a retail partnership with Walgreens, and a board stacked with political heavyweights like Henry Kissinger and George Shultz. Hundreds of employees joined the company to help it fulfill the ambitious mission of creating a cheaper and more efficient alternative to traditional medical tests. Then it all began to unravel. The Wall Street Journal published a  in 2015 questioning the company's technology and testing methods. Theranos was sued by  and had its blood-testing license revoked by the government. By 2018, its CEO Elizabeth Holmes had stepped down and its labs had closed. In September, Theranos announced plans to dissolve itself. Today, some of those employees are still trying to move on from a company that is now a household name for all the wrong reasons.These efforts may be complicated by Hollywood's interest in the story, including a new  out this month, ensuring the Theranos scandal remains very much in the public eye.While some former Theranos employees have landed at top-tier tech companies such as Facebook and Amazon, others have found themselves in a state of limbo, spending months or even years trying to secure new jobs with the stain of the company on their resume. The people having the most trouble tend to be those who worked at the company for longer, or held higher level positions in certain departments, according to interviews with outside recruiters and seven former employees. Most of the former employees spoke with CNN Business on condition of anonymity due to concerns about ongoing legal proceedings or having their names publicly associated with the company.One former Theranos employee recalled having lunch with a recruiter who had placed him at a previous job. The recruiter told him he was the most qualified candidate, before adding, except for this. Then the recruiter put a thumb over the word Theranos on the copy of his resume sitting on the table. Since then, the ex-employeehas been rejected for multiple jobs andis still searching. Others who have had interest from companies are still hesitant about their next moves. Janina Dong, a former recruiting manager at Theranos who left in 2017, has so far chosen to consult rather than take a full-time job. Part of the reason, she says, is because I am second-guessing my own judgment about where to work after failing to see Theranos for what it was. Much of the attention to date has rightly focused on the ways in which Theranos and Holmes duped investors and patients whose health was put at stake.But some former employees say they too were left in the dark, both about the viability of the technology and the financial health of the company. That case may be harder to make for those who worked there longer, rose up higher or stuck with the company well after the initial reports raised concerns about its technology. In the summer of 2016, months after the first Wall Street Journal report and more than a decade after the company's founding, Theranos still employed .There are people who got out of Theranos before everything went down. Those people managed to be fine, said Erika Cheung, a former Theranos lab worker who tipped off the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to look into the company. And then there are people who stayed for a really long time. Cheung worked at the company for less than a year and left before the investigative reports.Explanations and justifications vary among staffers who were there for years.  They really did keep people in their own little bubbles, said the former employee who has been rejected for multiple jobs. I think a lot of us were in denial, said another former employee who continued working at the company after the Wall Street Journal story. I know I was to a certain degree.This misplaced belief in Theranos has come at some personal and professional cost. One former employee said the stress of all the media scrutiny on the company led to burnout. I took off six months after the layoff to get over this, she said. I was exhausted, emotionally and physically. The employee, who has since taken a new job, admits this time off was a luxury most may not have had.Another former employee described working with a young startup only to part ways after being told that their Theranos pedigree might make it harder for the company to raise money. The former employee is now looking for new career opportunities outside their field of expertise after hitting a road block in the job search. Those doors right now are closed, the former employee said. It's just unfortunate.Obviously there's skepticism, said Sam Wholley, a partner at recruiting firm Riviera Partners, which works with tech companies like Uber and WeWork. At one point, Wholley said he was told by a company that even if a Theranos employee was the best person in the world, it still couldn't hire him or her. The reason, as he summed up the company's thinking: My board would kill me. CNN Business reached out to a dozen tech and biotech firms about their stances on hiring former Theranos staff. Multiple companies, including Verily, the life sciences division of Alphabet, and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, said they do not have any formal or informal policy prohibiting hiring someone with Theranos on their resume.Still, employees remain mindful of the impression their work with Theranos may create. Patrick O'Neill, the former chief creative officer at Theranos from 2014 to 2017, said he has removed much of his promotional work for the company from his professional website. Having it out for public consumption potentially could lead to a lot of criticism, he said. [Theranos] ended up hurting a lot of people.Last March, the Securities and Exchange Commission  Theranos and Holmes with massive fraud involving more than $700 million raised from investors. The SEC  Holmes and Theranos of deceiving investors and the media into thinking its portable blood analyzer could conduct comprehensive blood tests from finger drops of blood, revolutionizing the blood testing industry, when in fact it could complete only a small number of tests.Holmes settled with the SEC, agreeing to pay a fine and give up her voting control over Theranos, but she and the company did not admit to any wrongdoing. Three months later, Holmes was  and stepped down from Theranos. She could face a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. The company remains the subject of an ongoing criminal investigation by the . A lawyer for Elizabeth Holmes declined to comment for this story. Holmes pleaded not guilty to the charges of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud. Theranos' lawyer did not respond to multiple requests for comment.Many people who worked therenowhope the public conversation around the company simply passes them by. The former employee who was given the sobering talk by the recruiter remembers reading , the definitive tell-allbookon Theranos by Wall Street Journal reporter John Carreyrou, on his Kindle app when it first came out last May. The first thing I did was look for my name, he said. And happily, I was not in the book. Since then, there has been a on Theranos, a  on ABC and the upcoming Alex Gibney documentary on the company airing this month on HBO, called The Inventor: Out For Blood. Actress Jennifer Lawrence is also  as Holmes in a movie based on Bad Blood. (CNN and HBO share parent company WarnerMedia.)I have friends who call me on a weekly basis, and say, 'You should be happy you weren't in this podcast,' said the former employee who parted ways with a startup after Theranos.The former employee said there is a sense of dread about each new splashy media event around Theranos. You don't really want to remind yourself of all this. Most of it is pretty depressing.It also may have the effect of prolongingwhat Wholley, the recruiter, referred to as the cooling off period before public perception around a company like Theranos and the people who worked there starts to shift \u2014 if it ever does.I would expect it to be years \u2014 a couple of years, Wholley said. But as he points out, If you were a senior manager at Enron ... and you've had six jobs since then, someone is going to look at your resume and think of that."},

He said he thinks of the debris issue much as he thinks of environmental issues.There are so many ideas for satellites out there that are done without full consideration to the full cycle of the system: What happens to the plastic bottle when you throw it in the ocean? he said. It's the same problem. It's just at a different scale.The number of  satellites in our skies could more than triple over the next decade as more than 7,000 new devices are added, according to one . Experts fear that, as space becomes increasingly crowded, collisions could set off disastrous chain reactions. That could mean an end to scientific exploration, GPS service, satellite TV, internet and phone service for millions of people.OneWeb's satellites will retain enough fuel to veer back into the Earth's atmosphere at the end of their lives. And Wyler said they will also be outfitted with extra hardware that could make it easy for a grappling hook to snag and drag unresponsive satellites out of orbit.These are expensive technologies, he said. But they're things that we simply must do to be good citizens.It would take more than 2,000 years for Earth's gravity to drag OneWeb's satellites out of orbit if they were left alone at the end of their lives. But OneWeb has pledged to deorbit them within five years after they go offline. A recent NASA  suggested that all satellite operators will need to adopt that standard to reduce the risk of cataclysmic collisions.Wyler said he's been fortunate that OneWeb's backers, which include corporate giants like Softbank and Coca-Cola, have been receptive to spending extra cash to be good stewards of space.There's also a business incentive: Keeping their orbital planes clean will be essential for companies like OneWeb that are investing billions in their constellations, according to Shagun Sachdeva, an analyst at Northern Sky who has researched megaconstellations and orbital debris management.A big question is whether the broader, cost-conscious private sector will invest in adding technologies to their satellites.There are no punishments for companies that don't abide by NASA's recommendations or the much leaner international guideline, which is to deorbit satellites within 25 years after they shut down.

Experts have also questioned whether they deliver enough value given their financial costs, which can exceed hundreds of thousands of dollars.The audit examined programs that targeted locations and people for additional policing. A chronic-offender program tracked individuals to see if they were committing violations. A point system was implemented to determine who should be on the list. Points were given if a person was a gang member or on parole, had a history of violent crime, was arrested with a handgun, or had quality police contact a term that wasn't defined in department documents. However, the audit found nearly one in five people on the list had not received any points.Last year, theLAPDsuspended the chronic offenders list because of civil-rights concerns and inconsistencies in how it was administered.

Another of the predictive-policing programs, which was from the software company Predpol, relies on 10 years of crime data to suggest locations. Los Angeles police chief Michel Moore told the city's police commission last week that he believed data-driven policing would improve community safety, and that his department supported the audit's recommendation.I'm thankful that this report has come, Moore said.Experts say that Los Angeles' public review shows the value of audits, which hold law enforcement accountable but are a rarity even as departments increasingly adopt new technologies. If they embrace this idea of accountability and transparency, they can actually showcase the good, deal with the bad and move things forward in a really constructive way, said Andrew Ferguson, a law professor at the University of District of Columbia and author of The Rise of Big Data Policing.It's estimated that more than 50 police departments use technologies similar to theLAPD. A found that 38% of police departments said they used predictive policing, and 70% planned to within the next two to five years. Los Angeles is believed to be the first department to have audited its use of these cutting edge technologies.Auditors say their value to the departmentsis offering an independent and objective look.We don't sweep things under rug. We just say it how it is, said Kristine Adams-Wannberg, president of the Association of Local Government Auditors, which was not involved in the Los Angeles audit. If a police bureau has been touting their record to say hey, we're doing a really good job. An audit can come in to verify that.Adams-Wannberg said that Los Angeles has become a leader in police audits, dating to the fallout of a 2001 settlement with the Department of Justice over civil rights violations. Chicago, one of the largest police departments nationwide that's using technologies similar to Los Angeles, is trying an alternative to audits. It's partnered with the University of Chicago researchers to get feedback on its programs.All police departments should seek mechanisms of accountability and transparency. Accountability through academic studies and reports is beneficial, said Ferguson, the law professor. But there is no real substitute for local democratic accountability in a public and transparent forum.I don't know that you can have a stronger validation or efficacy model than an independent Ivy League university, said Anthony Guglielmi, a spokesman for the Chicago police department. They literally sit in the rooms with us. In early 2017, Chicago's police department set up small offices in two troubled neighborhoods for police officers and university data analysts to work together to better target police resourcesin order toreverse a rising trend of gun violence. The offices rely on a suite of technologies, including automatic gunshot detection, which alerts officers of shootings before 911 calls. They also use data analytics and a software program, HunchLab, that attempts to predict when and where crimes are likely totake place. A recent university analysis found a significant reduction in shootings in one of the neighborhoods when compared to other districts that didn't have one of the data-focused offices. The results are promising, but no one has studied which of the new tools drove the crime reduction. HunchLab, the type of predictive policing program that's been controversial, isn't being examined on its ownby the university.Even when there are promising results from the new systems,critics argue that more audits and transparency around the programs is critical to make sure the technology is actually effective and doesn't raise civil rights issues.  Police tend to give technological solutions a benefit of the doubt, said Eric L. Piza, a professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice\u00a0who has studied predictive policing, and believes more needs to be done to make sure the technology works well enough to justify the financial costs. It's so so rare that police take a longer look."},

It will list on the New York Stock Exchange under the stock ticker PINS.The company set a placeholder target of raising $100 million in the public offering, an amount that will likely change as it begins courting public market investors.Pinterest is the latest unicorn to stampede toward Wall Street this year.

And Uber, the biggest of the group, is expected to make its Wall Street debut later this year.In 2018, Pinterest posted revenue of $756 million, up from $473 million in the year prior. Like many tech companies going public, however, Pinterest is not yet profitable. The company lost $63 million in 2018, down from a net loss of $130 million in 2017. The company was founded in 2010 by Ben Silbermann, Evan Sharp and Paul Sciarra, the last of whom parted ways with the company early in its history. Over the years, Pinterest has tried to evolve from being a digital scrapbooking service to a visual discovery tool, positioning it as a potential competitor to products like Google Search.At the same time, Pinterest has long insisted it's not a social media service, despite building an ad-based platform where users can follow friends, colleagues and brands, and view their daily posts in a feed. At its most basic level, it's just about you, Silbermann told CNN Business in a . It's not about following the news. It's not about accruing followers. It's not about following celebrities. It's really about your personal interests.In the filing, Pinterest describes itself as a productivity tool rather than a social network. When listing off competitors, it starts with Amazon, rather than social networks like Facebook and Instagram. The fact that it's less focused on news sharing and virality has arguably helped insulate the company from recent criticisms of other social networks for spreading fake news and harmful content. Over the years, however, Pinterest has served as a platform for some , anti-vaccination content and posts glorifying eating disorders.

It is also very popular with a key demographic that is often overlooked by Silicon Valley: women.In the filing, Pinterest says two-thirds of its user base are women. More than that, it claims to have eight out of 10 moms in the US, who are often the primary decision-makers when it comes to buying products and services for their household."},

On the issue of obstruction, Barr and deputy A.G. Rod Rosenstein determined that the evidence was not sufficient to support prosecution. Trump, true to form, went too far and said he had been completely exonerated. But Sunday was just day one of a multi-day story...CNN's Jim Acosta reports that Trumpworld is going to go after the press  in the coming days. The Republican National Committee is already blasting out emails with titles like The Media Was Obsessed With The Democrat Lie. And many of Fox's talk show hosts are blasting CNN and MSNBC.A Trump adviser who speaks to the president regularly told Acosta to expect Trump and his team to slam and shame the media over Mueller's no-collusion conclusion. This is like Geraldo Rivera and Al Capone's vault all over again, the adviser said.The WaPo's White House team expects the same thing:  Trump plans to highlight the cost of the probe and call for organizations to fire members of the media and former government officials who he believes made false accusations about him. Sean Hannity's  tell you everything you need to know about Fox's programming plan for Monday. Right-wing pundits and members of Trump's inner circle are pushing journalists to apologize for the media's coverage of the Mueller probe. The reasoning seems to be that by covering the investigation, which ultimately did not indict anyone for conspiring with Russia, journalists hyped a baseless probe. Some critics are going further and saying the press lied and colluded to take down Trump. But I don't seem to recall these same pundits demanding journalists apologize for aggressively covering the Hillary Clinton email probe after James Comey decided not to bring charges. While the two aren't perfectly identical scenarios, they were similar situations, and I don't remember a rush to declare that Fox's credibility \u2014 or any other news organization's \u2014 was tarnished for coverage of it. -- We live in a big wild world of media. Try to tune out the partisans who paint with a broad brush \u2014 the ones who cherry-pick individual errors and try to punish the press as a whole. The rhetoric from folks like Donald Trump Jr. is predictable and cynical \u2014 they just want the media to be the enemy. -- The federal probes of Trump's campaign and inner circle were and still are BIG stories, period. And Trump's daily deceptions and strange actions gave Americans ample reason to be suspicious about his Russia ties. -- But: There were mistakes made in the course of the Trump-Russia coverage. And there were newsroom choices that merit reflection now. What did the sheer volume of the coverage signal to viewers? Take Rachel Maddow's fans, for example. On Sunday Glenn Greenwald  her of feeding millions of people conspiratorial garbage. Do Maddow's viewers feel misled right about now? --  There's been so much solid reporting about the Trump-Russia mystery, but the media ecosystem tends to reward speculation over straight news. Are there ways to change this? -- Mostly I agree with Emily Bell's : If the main story coming out of Mueller is a media story \u2014 that cannot be right. Y'all need to get off Twitter for a couple of days.  -- Want to get a feel for right-wing reactions against the press? Take a  or  -- Matt Taibbi's : He said news that Mueller is headed home without issuing new charges is a death-blow for the reputation of the American news media and called Russiagate this generation's WMD. -- Franklin Foer's : Mueller has apparently endorsed the fundamental underlying case emanating from the intelligence community: The Russians were actively working to secure Trump's victory. -- Rich Lowry's post for  The media coverage of the Russia investigation was abysmal and self-discrediting \u2014obsessive and hysterical, often suggesting that the smoking gun was right around the corner, sometimes supporting its hoped-for result with erroneous, too-good-to check reporting. Never has so little come of so many screaming chyrons. -- And here's a counterpoint from Ryan Lizza: Contra a lot of commentary: given the issues, stakes, and seriousness with which special counsel treated all of this, the media's coverage of Russia-Trump connection and possible obstruction over the last two years was somewhere between about right and not quite aggressive enough. NYT executive editor Dean Baquet to the  I'm comfortable with our coverage. It is never our job to determine illegality, but to expose the actions of people in power. And that's what we and others have done and will continue to do.  -- Michael Calderone's headline for Politico:  after Mueller report underwhelms...-- THR's Jeremy Barr says all this chatter is premature: No need to write these stories yet, he tweeted. Without all the info, we are essentially ~speculating~ that the media messed up by speculating too much about Russia.-- Matt Lewis : Regular viewers of liberal-leaning cable news outlets may have an especially hard time grappling with the fact that the narrative has suddenly gone bust.-- The bottom line, from Chuck Todd, speaking on MSNBC: This isn't getting resolved in this country until November 2020. For the better part of the last two years, members of the pro-Trump media have argued that the probe into Russian election interference was a witch hunt and suggested Mueller was a deep state dirty cop. Now we know that Mueller's report has cleared Trump on conspiracy with Russia. So either Mueller was a lousy dirty cop, or everything these right-wing talking heads have been shouting on Fox News prime time was false. In fact, Mueller arrived at a conclusion where the facts took him. His conclusion proves that this was no rigged witch hunt. As Joe Walsh tweeted, All those 'witch hunt/deep state' folks who maligned Mueller's character for 22 months owe Robert Mueller an apology. He did his job and did it well.-- Julia Ioffe tweeted: I'm old enough to remember when the President said we shouldn't believe anything Mueller said. Mueller achieved almost mythical status in America. As one of the characters in this national drama, his name came to mean so many different things to so many different people. Hopefully, in the end, his name will mean truth. Now that he's leaving the playing field, don't expect to see Mueller sit down for a TV interview or anything like that. But the other characters are still playing... Republicans are accusing Democrats of moving the goalposts... and journalists are trying to keep up with the game...-- Before Barr's letter came out, the president played golf with a group of men, including Fox News contributor Trey Gowdy...-- Noted Mueller watcher Garrett Graff says he -- NPR produced special editions of  about the Mueller report on Friday night and again Sunday night...-- -- NBC was the first of the broadcast networks to break in, at 3:36 p.m., with Kate Snow anchoring and Pete Williams doing an outstanding job of reading the letter aloud and analyzing it in real time...-- George Stephanopoulos anchored on ABC when the news came down...David Muir came in for World News Tonight...-- CBS aired four news cut-ins during CBS Sports' March Madness coverage...-- Wolf Blitzer was in the anchor chair on CNN when the letter came in, joined by Dana Bash and a full house...

The key is brevity and gratefulness, said Rossi. You want to honor where you were.Sprinkle in a few positive recollections of successful projects or fun office memories. But this isn't the place for a detailed roadmap of your entire career at the company. No one wants or has time to read your soliloquy of how fabulous your time was, said Mary Abbajay, president of business management consulting firm Careerstone Group.If you are able, give a little hint about your next move to avoid any gossip or speculation.You don't have to give specific details like the name of your new employer. You can be more general by saying something like: I had the opportunity for a long-term consulting job and I threw my hat in the ring and I am really excited about it, suggested Rossi. Be sure to include your contact information at the end of the note. If you aren't comfortable sharing an email address, a link to your LinkedIn page will suffice. Your colleagues are your greatest assets for your professional career, said Abbajay. It's incredibly important to maintain the relationships. You never know when you will need them or they will need you.If you are sending the note to a big group, using the BCC option helps avoid any accidental reply all situations and protects the privacy of your recipients.When you send the note is up to you. Sending it days ahead of your last day could make it hard to finish up your work if people keep stopping by to wish you luck, or create some awkward interactions if you keep running into people who have already said their goodbyes.Many people choose to send the note just before they walk out the door, but that means you might miss any replies if you don't have access to your work email anymore. You can send the note from your personal email, but there is the risk that it could end up in people's spam folders.Adding your name in the subject line can avoid it getting overlooked, recommended Abbajay.Professional emails from personal accounts should also sound and feel professional. There are going to be some people who had a bigger impact on your career, and they should get a separate note of gratitude. These more personal notes can be handwritten or via email, and should be more thoughtful. It should be meaningful and sincere \u2014 the more specific you can be shows you put some thought into it, said Kate Zabriskie, president of Business Training Works.Remember that maintaining relationships is a two-way street. Once you get settled into your new job, reach out to your colleagues to give them an update and see how they are doing.  After all, previous bosses tend to make good professional references so it's in your best interest to keep in touch with them.Even if you are being asked to leave, it's still a good idea to send a note. But Zabriskie suggested leaving out the sappy stuff.A quick email along the lines of I enjoyed working with everyone, and I look forward to keeping in touch as I move on to the next phase of my career, should do the trick. And while it might be tempting to call out a bad manager or refute the reason you were fired, resist. It's important to close out the chapter with dignity and in a way that is professional.

{"title": "Ferrari and Lamborghini say 'Not so fast' on electric supercars", "cate": "business", "content": "Sure, a Tesla Model S sedan can go from zero to 60 miles an hour in 2.3 seconds, at least as quick as a supercar from Lamborghini or Ferrari.But both of those Italian automakers say electric car technology isn't ready for real high-performance supercars just yet.That's because supercar performance means more than launching from a stoplight as fast as possible. It means rounding curves at high speeds and accelerating, not just from a dead stop but at high speeds, over and over again.Electric cars need big battery packs to store enough power for acceleration and long driving range. Those battery packs usually weigh even more than a gasoline-powered car's engine and transmission. Makers of electric cars will often boast thatthe battery weight isdown in the floor, providing for a lower center of gravity and, theoretically, better handling. But the simple fact is, more weight is just never good for a sports car. Then there's the sound. Or, rather, the lack of sound. Ferrari and Lamborghini take pains to provide drivers with a rich symphony of rapid-fire internal combustion. The gentlewhirring of electric motors can be cool in its own right, but it's far from the ripping metallic howl of a Ferrari V12. Fake engine noise could be pumped into the cabin \u2014 some automakers already do this, even in gasoline-powered cars \u2014 but Ferrari's chief technology officer, Michael Hugo Leiters, called the idea unthinkable for his brand.We have to have a certain credibility, he said at a press conference during the Geneva Motor Show.Ferrari has said it plans to offer a new hybrid supercar in the near future, but that an all-electric Ferrari remains farther off.Maurizio Reggiani, chief technical officer at Lamborghini, detailed the packaging challenges of big battery packs during a conversation behind the scenes at the Geneva Show. Yes, batteries can be laid down flat in the floor of the car, as they are in Teslas. But if you've ever sat in a Lamborghini sports car you'll know there's not much room between your seat and the road. Adding space for batteries would mean making the cars taller sacrificing much of that low center of gravity benefit.Rimac, based in Croatia, makes electric supercars today albeit at extremely high prices, even by supercar standards. The Rimac C_Two costs over $2 million. The company also contributed engineering to the , another $2 million electric supercar unveiled at the Geneva Motor Show earlier in March.Founder Mate Rimac said he didn't start an electric supercar company because he wanted to save the environment. There are far betters ways to do that. He believes that electric propulsion, with its instant acceleration and precise control of power to the wheels, holds the promise of ultimate supercar performance.It was surprising, then, to hear him agree with much of what engineers from Lamborghini and Ferrari had to say. What is a big challenge is long-term performance, thermal limitations of overheating batteries and powertrains, he said. So that's something we are working really hard to solve and I think we can solve that but it's a big, big challenge.Batteries can get hot when lots of power is pushed in and out of them quickly, limiting the amount of time a car can spend going full speed around a track. Weight is also a major issue, he agreed. Rimac's car, he said, is most comparable to something like the , a fairly large, heavy car designed to provide exhilarating performance but it's not really at home on a twisting race track.Lamborghini's proposed solution is a technological long shot. The company is working with engineers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology on the use of. The car body would become a supercapacitor. Supercapacitors take in and release energy much more rapidly than batteries can. But there are serious technological hurdles. For one thing, supercapacitors have trouble holding energy for a long time.When the first electric supercars from companies like Ferrari and Lamborghini do come out, don't expect them to just stop making internal combustion engine cars, said Robert Sorokanich, the deputy online editor of Road & Track. Electric cars will always offer a different sort of performance from an internal combustion-powered car and there will be those who still prefer the experience of an Italian V12."},

But so can knowing when to say no. There are some situations where pushing back and setting boundaries is appropriate and a good career move, said Lindsey Pollak, author of The Remix: How to Lead and Succeed in the Multigenerational Workforce.Saying no means establishing boundaries, which can boost your productivity and help foster a better work-life balance. Senior leaders don't want to surround themselves with a bunch of 'yes' people, they want to be challenged in their own thinking and get outside of their own bubbles, said Liz Nolley Tillman, author of Great Work, Great Rewards.There are going to be times when you're asked to complete an assignment or work on something outside of your role. Taking on the task can show you're a team player who wants to help the company succeed. But when it becomes a pattern, that can be a problem. For instance, being the only woman in the meeting and always being asked to take notes, get coffee, book the room or make copies can hurt your career growth. That can impact your branding and credibility, said Dana Brownlee, president of Professionalism Matters and author of The Unwritten Rules of Managing Up: Project Management Techniques from the Trenches.She recommended agreeing to help, but also suggesting a rotating schedule where other colleagues take on the responsibilitiesto avoid looking uncooperative and getting saddled with all the office housekeeping tasks all the time.It's great to be the go-to person at work. And when you consistently do a good job, managers tend to come to you with more projects But when you're too bogged down with various projects, deadlines and assignments you become less-efficient and productive, and the quality of work can suffer. The onus is on you to somewhat push back to benefit you and the organization, said Brownlee. If flatly saying no to your boss isn't an option, take a more tactful approach. Sometimes bosses don't realize how much is on your plate, so let them know and ask how they'd like you to re-prioritize. You can also let them know that by accepting a new assignment, another one might get delayed. Sometimes we have to remind people of the consequences and put it back in their court, she said. Top performers can also end up getting promoted to management roles, but not everyone is interested in managing people or cut out for the job.Honesty is the best policy, said Brownlee. It's perfectly fine to say you don't think it's the right fit at this time. But be upfront with your employer and set expectations about your career goals. You are going to have to be proactive and take on the responsibility of navigating your career path yourself, said Pollak. You want to make sure your goals and expectations are in alignment with what your employer is expecting of you, and that's about communication.If you're turning down a project or task, try adding value to the situation. You can say no, but be part of the solution, said Pollak. Suggest another co-worker who might be more experienced or looking for a new project. You are showing you understand the person has a need and that you want to be a supportive colleague, Pollak said.Don't be shy about asking for certain terms or setting realistic expectations if you are going beyond your role or taking on an excessive amount of work.  For instance, if you are being asked to cover weekends, request to do it remotely. Or if it's a big project, ask for a team to manage in order to enhance your leadership experience or training. You want to strategically say yes, said Brownee. Sometimes that can be negotiating."},

She has to make it work", "cate": "business", "content": "The last two executives to run Walmart had overseen the company's international business.

McKenna took over in February 2018, and three months later Walmart International signed its biggest deal ever \u2014 spending $16 billion to . She was appointed as Walmart International CEO after spending three years as the chief operating officer for the company's main US business.In a statement, McKenna described the Flipkart alliance as a good cultural fit that aligned with Walmart's aim to contribute to India's success story, as we grow our business.Satish Meena, a senior analyst at Forrester Research, was blunt about what's riding on the Flipkart deal: This is Walmart's biggest bet on e-commerce. ... If they fail to execute with Flipkart here it is certainly going to be a big setback. The easy part of this deal is done. The difficult part starts now.Taking over Flipkart gave Walmart a massive jump on a market projected to be worth $200 billion by 2026 in a country that the American giant has been trying to crack for years. India's rules about foreign investment have prevented Walmart from opening its classic stores in the country, restricting it instead to 23 wholesale distribution outlets.We are delighted to learn from, contribute to and work with Flipkart to grow in India, one of the fastest-growing and most attractive retail markets in world, McKenna said in a statement in August, when the deal was officially completed. Walmart was unable to accommodate a request for an interview with McKenna for this story.The arrangement with Flipkart is anything but risk-free. What was initially billed as a massive coup has begun to show a fewcracks. Walmart, which said it wouldpump another $2 billion into Flipkart as part of the dealto accelerate growth, announced in Octoberthat the acquisition would in the last quarter of 2018.In February, the company conceded it had taken a hit from the deal, but said it would pay off in the end. The warning signs may have been there. Flipkart is not publicly traded and does not disclose its finances, but regulatory filings in India  said combined losses at its two main units  in the fiscal year ended March 2018, before Walmart took over. The Bangalore-based company's model of sacrificing profitability for the sake of rapid growth will not fly with Walmart, according to Meena of Forrester Research. Walmart is not going to look for growth at any cost, Meena tells CNN Business. They are looking for growth, but at the same time they have profitability in their mind, because now they have to go straight to the investors every quarter in terms of what is happening in India.That could be a tough transition to make, and Meena anticipates Flipkart's losses will continue to mount for at least a year \u2014 maybe two. The financial troubles were compounded by the shock exit of Flipkart's co-founder and CEO Binny Bansal. He  last November after an investigation into allegations of serious personal misconduct. Walmart has not revealed details of the allegations against Bansal, saying that while its investigation did not find evidence to back them up, it did reveal other lapses in judgment on his part. Bansal remains a Flipkart shareholder and continues to sit on the company's board. When he left, Bansal said he had been planning to stay on for a few more quarters to manage the transition, but that his decision to step down had been accelerated by recent events. Meena said that Bansal's exit was less of a setback to Walmart, because it was looking for both founders to step away eventually. (Co-founder Sachin Bansal, not related to Binny, sold his stake and stepped down as executive chairman when the deal happened.)The only thing is the way Binny exited was not in good taste, but Walmart was always prepared to work without the founders, he said.Still, the churn within Flipkart's top ranks could allow Walmart's arch rival Amazon, with its more established and stable India business, to gain ground at its expense. Another jolt came in late December, when the Indian government  on both companies. The rules, which took effect on February 1, ban non-Indian online retailers from offering their customers exclusive products such as smartphones or selling their own products through affiliated companies. Flipkart and Amazon have captured a large share of the Indian market by offering steep discounts and exclusive deals, but the new rules threaten to slam the brakes on that growth. As Walmart tries to move on from those setbacks, it has at the helm someone with decades of experience. McKenna has been with Walmart for more than twenty years, having first joined its UK subsidiary Asda in 1996. She served as Asda's chief operating officer and chief financial officer before taking on the lead strategy role for Walmart's overall international business. Walmart decided to sell Asda to local rivalSainsbury's in a  announced just days before the Flipkart acquisition. The Asda sale is still awaiting regulatory approval. McKenna moved to Walmart US in 2014, starting as chief development officer for its business unitbefore being promoted to executive vice president and chief operating officer of Walmart US just months later. Judith is obviously a veteran at Walmart and she's really supportive of what we're trying to do, Binny Bansal said in an interview with CNN Business in October, one month before he stepped down. Bansal said McKenna and the rest of Walmart's leadership had taken a relatively hands-off approach with Flipkart up to that point, saying both companies were in the learning phase about each other. I think they [have] bought into the vision that we have and what we are trying to do here, he added.Despite the teething problems with Flipkart, Meena said Walmart has been smart about the bets it's made, under McKenna's leadership, like dialing back its UK operation and  in Japan. As of now, none of the bets have converted into results, he said. It is very early to speak but ... it gives Walmart a fighting chance in the coming years.More from : Gwynne Shotwell  into a real business "},

The internet, while so important to modern life, can also be used to help perpetrate the greatest evils. Congress can help address the problem, and it's time for lawmakers to act.While the First Amendment protects free speech, true threats \u2014 like terrorist statements that express serious intent to commit violent acts against individuals and groups \u2014 are not constitutionally protected.However, social platforms and ISPs have little legal incentive to regulate such communications on their platforms since they very rarely bare responsibility for what most users post or say. That's because Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996 says companies that provide internet services, as well as platforms and websites, are immune from all but a few types of lawsuits, such as those involving child pornography and human trafficking.Congress should draft a new law establishing standards for social media companies and ISPs to take down the terrorist content they're aware of. Congress already has authority to act against organizations that knowingly provide resources to foreign terrorist organizations. A new law should prohibit similar coordination between digital companies and domestic terrorist groups. Passing detailed regulations would encourage companies to improve their monitoring technology and algorithms to be at least capable of recognizing true threats and incitements posted on their sites. Moreover, legislators should add penalties for companies that fail to do so, as it would be in keeping with  on the First Amendment.Digital companies capable of editing out nudity and copyright infringements should be required to do the same for terrorists' threats. A year ago, Congress passed the Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act, thereby ending immunity from liability for web services that sex traffickers use to do business. So too, should legislators enact a provision that says social media companies and ISPs are liable if they retain terrorists' threatening posts.This will bring US laws more in line with other democracies, such as France, where internet service providers are required to remove terrorist speech upon adequate notice from government authorities.Federal standards need to be set in this area. Social media companies would thereby be better incentivized to police their websites for terrorist content and to more quickly act when they become aware of it."},
{"title": "Banks don't want to work with marijuana companies. It's time for that to change", "cate": "business", "content": "With thousands of cannabis businesses popping up in states that have legalized marijuana for medicinal or recreational use, one important problem remains: banking access. Since cannabis remains illegal under federal law \u2014 and the federal government oversees all US banks and credit unions \u2014 banks are often skittish about granting bank accounts to these businesses. The failure to find a policy solution at the federal level has created several economic challenges and costly unintended consequences. Congress needs to pass legislation that makes clear that banks can work with marijuana companies in states that have legalized it without fear of penalty or costly red tape. Only one in about 30  or  across the United States  as a customer. Those that do take on cannabis companies often charge them hefty monthly account and transaction fees, in part to help offset the extra costs they incur by doing so. While there is no law that says banks can or cannot do business with cannabis companies, banks are required to  to Uncle Sam detailing a customer's suspicious or illegal activities. That can prove costly. A bank can be subject to large fines if it incorrectly reports on its transactions, or if a future bank regulator accuses it of not following the  properly. The reporting can be extensive, often covering every single action a customer takes, as it is based on the premise that the illegal activity is happening underground and the money trail is necessary to find the criminals. One small credit union in Oregon that serves marijuana businesses filed  over the past two years for approximately 500 cannabis clients. The cost of these reports are passed on to the marijuana companies \u2014 often at a premium \u2014 and then on to consumers. This can make it more difficult for sick patients to afford state-regulated medical marijuana products and can lead to higher arrest rates among people who can't afford to buy on the legal market.The challenges are even more difficult in places where cannabis businesses do not have any access to a bank. This makes it harder for regulators and law enforcement officials to conduct investigations and enforce the law because there is even less information available. Just like in any industry, accounting practices via financial institutions and electronic payment processing systems provide forensic evidence that can make it easier to identify illegal practices. At the same time, these records can also protect cannabis businesses by providing third-party proof when they are in compliance.Over the past , state after state has moved to legalize some form of cannabis. In 2013, the Obama administration signed the Cole Memorandum, which effectively created a federal safe harbor for cannabis businesses to operate by employing a hands-off approach of non-enforcement against cannabis businesses and users who comply with state laws. But in January of last year, former attorney general Jeff Sessions rescinded the Cole Memo, creating an environment of uncertainty, especially among financial institutions.Simple, bipartisan solutions to the cannabis banking debate exist, such as the SAFE Act and the STATES Act. These bills take different approaches: One works to create a safe harbor for banks to serve marijuana companies without unnecessary expensive reporting costs and possible future sanctions; the other amends the Controlled Substances Act to affect cannabis' illegal status. Either could be strengthened to create a safe harbor for banks to treat state-licensed cannabis businesses more like any other business. The U.S. Treasury Department, which has authority over anti-money laundering regulations, could do this administratively as well. Bank regulators could also play a larger role by providing guidance and support for banks that choose to serve cannabis companies. The San Francisco arm of the Federal Reserve has been far more engaged in providing guidance to banks, while the Kansas City Regional Bank has gone to court (using a  of their legal authority) to stop a new credit union from serving marijuana businesses. The banking problem in cannabis is actively working against the major policy goals of voters and legislators in each of the states that have legalized commercial marijuana. That problem can and should be fixed quickly, even if the ultimate decision on cannabis will take longer."},
{"title": "What Facebook, Twitter and YouTube can do now to stop terrorism and hate online ", "cate": "business", "content": "The attacks on two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand bring into sharp relief a troubling pattern of global white nationalist terrorism against Muslims. The New Zealand assailant's  is replete with white supremacist propaganda that was shared across the internet. Social media sites like Facebook, Twitter and YouTube are now left scrambling to stop the spread of this hateful rhetoric as it continues to get shared across their platforms. Washington Post reporter Drew Harwell's  captures the significant role that the internet played in this attack: The New Zealand massacre was livestreamed on Facebook, announced on 8chan, reposted on YouTube, commentated about on Reddit, and mirrored around the world before the tech companies could even react. it has removed 1.5 million videos of the attack.  on Friday it was working to remove the video from its platform. YouTube said it removes violent and graphic content as soon as it's made aware of it.  it is responding to law enforcement. But there are steps these companies can take now to help mitigate the damage and prevent terrorist attacks like this from happening in the future.  It's clear that the internet \u2014 and social media in particular \u2014 plays a key role in amplifying conspiracy theories, misinformation and myths about Muslims. But the internet didn't create these things \u2014 anti-Muslim sentiment long predates the internet. In a , we documented 763 separate anti-Muslim incidents in the United States between 2012 and today. Of the 763 incidents, there have been 178 hate incidents against mosques and Islamic centers in America and another 197 incidents of anti-Muslim violent crimes. It's difficult to know the assailant's precise path to radicalization. How much violent extremist material was he consuming online? Was he part of a community of extreme hate on 8chan, or some other platform? Did YouTube's recommendation algorithms pull him into an echo chamber of hate and vitriol against Muslims? The truth is that we may never know the answers to these questions. What's more, there are real challenges to curtailing online hate: namely, there are  to adequately address domestic terrorism.  Labeling those who use social media and other technologies to incite violence as domestic terrorists would give tech companies the legal leverage they need to take down their content or block them altogether. Without legislation, we are left with competing, if not fuzzy, ideas about what constitutes acceptable and unacceptable forms of hate speech.These challenges are compounded by the sheer amount of content that goes online every day. Every single minute there are on average  uploaded to YouTube; , 293,000 updated statuses and 136,000 photos posted on Facebook; and  posted on Twitter. Notwithstanding these challenges, there are concrete and immediate actions tech companies should take to address anti-Muslim hate online. YouTube should turn off recommendations on anti-Muslim content that pushes misinformation and disinformation. Not all of this content breaches its terms of service, but it often pushes right up to the line, making some of this content hard to police. But there's no reason the algorithm should be recommending anti-Muslim and toxic content. This won't be an easy fix for YouTube, but this latest terrorist attack should be a clarion call for the company to dedicate real resources to address this specific problem.Google, Facebook, Twitter and Microsoft should also establish a forum looking at hate targeting minority communities. This would be an industry-led initiative to identify, better understand, and disrupt hateful content and dangerous speech used on their services. The forum would be modeled after, but separate from, the industry-led , which seeks to find industry wide ways of stopping terrorists from promoting and disseminating terrorist propaganda through online platforms. The new forum would allow for expertise and input from a wide range of individuals and organizations, which would only help tech companies better understand and address hateful content and activities -- in all its forms and manifestations -- against a range of minority communities. These immediate and needed steps won't rid the world of the anti-Muslim hate, but they will be important first steps by the tech companies to help curtail hate and dangerous speech on their services. And this, in turn, could help mitigate future terrorist attacks."},

Gold, trading for more than $1,300 an ounce, is a much pricier investment than silver, which currently costs about $15 an ounce. In other words, you could purchase more than 40 ounces of silver for the same price as one half ounce of gold.Investors treat gold more like a currency than silver, a metal that has many more industrial uses than gold. So if you want to buy silver, don't necessarily expect it to perform in tandem with gold.Silver prices are actually down nearly 25% over the past five years while gold prices have been relatively flat. Silver has been hit harder, because investors are worried about slowing global economic growth. But both metals have undeperformed the broader stock market.  Still, investing experts say that gold, silver and other precious metals like platinum and palladium, could make sense as a small part of a broader investment portfolio. Many people own them simply to hedge against big pullbacks in stocks. They are also viewed as a good alternative to government-backed currencies -- which tend to fluctuate more with central bank decisions on interest rates. Investors view bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as assets that could behave similarly to gold and silver.Now that the US Federal Reserve is apparently done raising interest rates for the foreseeable future, that should bode well for gold and silver, when rates are low.Metals are set to be primary beneficiaries of the Federal Reserve simply catching up to futures markets priced for easing. Further hikes are unlikely, said Bloomberg Intelligence senior commodity strategist Mike McGlone  Friday.   But silver might be more attractive than gold right now -- and not just because it's a heck of a lot cheaper to purchase. Many commodities analysts closely follow the ratio of the price of one ounce of gold to one ounce of silver. It's flashing a buy signal.Historically, there have been only a few occasions that the gold-silver ratio traded above 80, said analysts at Blanchard, a precious metals investing firm in New Orleans, .The gold/silver ratio stands at 85 right now. That signals that silver is dramatically undervalued, the Blanchard analysts said. That said, if you are going to buy gold, silver or any other metals, it's probably easier to do so through an exchange-traded fund that tracks the price of the metal instead of pulling a Scrooge McDuck and actually purchasing bars and coins to swim around in.The   is one of the largest funds in the world, with about $33 billion in assets.

We did not promote general partners from within.But all that changed with Connie Chan. Chan had joined the firm in 2011 asan analyst. She quickly built a reputation for spotting trends in consumer tech, and sourcingmegadeals with startups like Pinterest and Lime.She also proved herself vital to the firm as head of its Asia network. Known in some circles as  she has helped businesses thrive in the world's second biggest economy. Her promise and ambition were clear early on, according to Horowitz. He recalls interviewing her for a job eight years ago, saying that he felt an immediate conflict with where she was going and the way we had constructed the firm.I had seen something in Connie that in the course of my career, I had almost never seen. From the way she answered every question to the way she had analyzed the firm to the poise she exhibited in the very way she sat in the chair, Connie was determined to be the best at everything she did, Horowitz wrote in a .The old rule started to seem dated and out of place. So last year, Andreessen Horowitz got rid of the rule and made Chan a partner.The move to abolish the rule was seen by many as a crucial step away from the perceived boys' club culture on Sand Hill Road. As of 2017,  of partners at the world's top 100 venture capital firms were women, a Crunchbase study found. And at last count, 74% of US VC firms , according to All Raise, a nonprofit organization that aims to improve diversity in the sector. Chan's chapter at Andreessen Horowitz began unexpectedly. In 2011, she was leading HP's efforts to launch a new operating system in China when a message popped up on LinkedIn: Someone liked her profile, and wanted to have coffee. That eventually landed her the interview that impressed Ben Horowitz. Honestly, it's like a grace-of-God moment, she told CNN Business. The cool confidence Chan has become known fordidn't always come easily. Growing up in the Bay Area, Chan felt she was constantly being underestimated. I was always told I was very quiet and soft-spoken, and probably wasn't taken very seriously, Chan recalled. People thought I was shy, or I didn't speak up enough in class.Tired of hearing that she was too introverted, Chan pushed herself out of her comfort zonewhen she started attending Stanford University for undergrad. She enrolled in a public speaking class, studied how to project her voice more and even tried out \u2014 and toured with \u2014 an a capella group.I've taken on this kind of 'why not' attitude. Why not try something new? Why not go audition for this random singing group, right? Why not try something random? And that's the same thing I take when I go into investing. I'm very open to looking at new categories of investment, she said. Throughout her career, Chan has often been one of the only women in the room. But instead of feeling isolated, I've found it to be helpful in certain cases, she said. In 2011, she was the only female investor on the team when Andreessen Horowitz started looking at Pinterest.Most of the social networkingsite's audience was female, and she quickly realized none of her colleagues were a target user.Within a week of trying the platform, Chan was convinced the firm should invest. She pushed for a deal, and Andreessen Horowitz wound up leading a $27 million funding round in Pinterest. I could see and bring a point of view that the other folks could not see, said Chan.The company has since reportedly raised as much as $1.5 billion from investors. A similar experience led the firm to Lime, the electric scooter startup.In 2017, bike-sharing  in China, and Chan had a friend who'd invested inBeijing-based Ofo, one of the leading startups at the time. That inspired her to start watching companies in that space. I had 10 months of lead time to understand that business model, she said. Because I had that kind of special intel, information, I was able to bet on Lime really, really early on. Like when we made that bet, [the founders] hadn't even fully left their full-time jobs yet.Andreessen Horowitz poured $10 million into Lime, which has since  and raised $777 million in financing. Her different perspective landed us Pinterest and Lime early on when our conventional thinking would have failed, Horowitz wrote.Studies have shown that investing in diverse leadership has been good for business. According to a 2018, venture capital firms that increased the number of female partners they hired by even 10% saw a bump in overall fund returns. They also had almost 10% more profitable exits from investments, the study showed.The more similar the investment partners, the lower their investments' performance, researchers said of their findings.Chan's promotion could prove vital to Andreessen Horowitz's future.She is known forspotting game-changing ideas in Asia that could transfer back to the United States. The general view is that Silicon Valley is where you find all the innovation, she said. I really believe that you see a lot of innovation coming from other parts of the world. She says she's currently looking for the Western equivalent of Pinduoduo,  valued at $33 billion that allows people to save money when they enlist friends to buy the same item. She also seesChinese firms monetizing video in a unique way she doesn't see happening stateside. And , American playersare just starting to develop  which position themselves as all-in-one platforms where users can do everything, from message friends to binge-watch videos to online shop. Since the returns on her investments often take years to realize, you have to make calls that look crazy, said Chan.That is something that I'm always telling younger analysts and associates: 'Don't be afraid to say your true point of view, even if it's in disagreement with your direct boss,' she said. I don't care if it's Marc Andreessen or Ben Horowitz, or anyone who is extremely famous or well-accomplished, who disagrees with me. I'm very willing to share my point of view."},

But anticipation of a full-blown Saudi pivot to Asia \u2014 and a turning away from the United States \u2014 is misguided. Cooperation between the kingdom and Asia is growing, but at best, relations with Asian countries can only complement US ties.Mohammed bin Salman's Asia tour, coming two years after his father's historic  through the region, saw the Saudis committing billions in investments at each stop. In Pakistan, Mohammed bin Salman signed agreements worth $20 billion, including a $10 billion deal for an oil . In India, he identified $100 billion of opportunities, while agreements  in China included a $10 billion refinery and petrochemicals deal.The young royal's outreach to Asia makes strategic sense. In addition to shoring up allies, there are several factors attracting the Saudis to Asia. Politically, Asian states \u2014 with their own patchy domestic records \u2014 are less likely to push Saudi Arabia on sensitive issues that are perennial points of contention between Riyadh and western capitals, such as human rights abuses or support for radical Islamists. For instance, even though Pakistan-based terror group Jaish-e-Mohammed was outlawed in 2002,  for not doing more to stop terrorist groups. China, meanwhile, has forcibly  at least 800,000 members of Muslim minorities in re-education camps rife with  of torture.Economically, Asian countries guzzle most of Saudi Arabia's oil. Of the kingdom's top five buyers, four are Asian countries, Middle East Economic Survey  shows, and China is  to increase its Saudi imports this year. Asian markets and investments from the region are a crucial  of Vision 2030, Saudi Arabia's economic reform initiative. Asia is a major target of Saudi Arabia's diversification plans: State-owned Aramco is building a massive  and petrochemicals complex in India, on top of the Pakistan and China refinery deals announced during the crown prince's tour. Despite the kingdom's outreach, a full-fledged pivot to Asia is hardly imminent. For one thing, Asian countries' commitments to the kingdom likely fall far short of what Saudi Arabia would like. Saudi Arabia and Iran have long been rivals, and Saudi Arabia would be hard-pressed to convince Asian states to take its side. Risk-averse Asian countries would likely have little appetite for entering the Middle East muddle and would much prefer continuing to do business with both countries. The United States, on the other hand, has a decades-long  with Saudi Arabia against Iran.Even if Asian countries had the intent, they do not possess the capacity to replace the United States, particularly regarding military prowess. Saudi Arabia is certainly interested in Chinese military equipment, having  drones from Beijing and announcing its intent to build a domestic drone industry with Chinese help. But Washington is still the kingdom's top weapons supplier,  68% of Saudi arms imports between 2014 and 2018. Moreover, Saudi Arabia will find it tough to integrate Chinese equipment with its American arsenal \u2014 it would run into major  trying to integrate Chinese-made weapons into its American-based systems, particularly given its decades of usage and stockpiling of US systems.Moreover, Asian militaries cannot substitute the US military's regional presence or match its ability. China is muscling up abroad, having established its first overseas military  in Djibouti in 2017. But its forays are expeditionary in comparison to the United States' built-up regional presence. The US has had one of its largest bases in the Middle East: The US Central Command has been in Qatar for , with its forward headquarters at Al Udeid \u2014 which Qatar is now expanding and hoping to make .Economically, Asia cannot replace the US market for the Saudis. China might be the kingdom's largest trading partner, having  $46 billion from the kingdom last year, but Riyadh's  in 2017 two-way trade with Washington is substantial. On top of that, it owns our country's  in Texas.Mohammed bin Salman's tech diversification  will need the knowledge and expertise of Silicon Valley. Tech is a  of Vision 2030, with emphasis on building a digital infrastructure and expanding into e-commerce, migrating government services online, and increasing investments in emerging technologies. The Public Investment Fund, Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund, is the main vehicle undertaking Mohammed bin Salman's tech drive via its  of a slew of stakes in top-tier  including Uber, Tesla and electric car maker Lucid Motors. The fund is even planning on  in New York, London and San Francisco. On top of its direct investments, PIF has funneled billions more into US-based startups, including Slack, WeWork and DoorDash through its joint venture with Japan's SoftBank, the SoftBank Vision Fund, to which it contributed $45 billion. These dynamics could change over time, as US retrenchment from the region might not be a reversible phenomenon. The kingdom is not likely to pull back on its outreach to Asia. But Asian countries are not an imminent replacement to Washington in the kingdom's foreign relations. Riyadh will still need the West. "},

But in manufacturing, the technology is already making a difference. Next-generation 5G networks can be , making communication between devices and servers much faster. The networks can be installed in relatively small areas \u2014 like a factory \u2014 without too much fuss. The combination of speed, practicality and potential cost savings is encouraging factory operators to experiment with 5G. The results have been positive, suggesting the tech may be widely used in factories before smartphones and other consumer products, especially because surveys show many consumers are not yet willing to pay more for 5G.Ericsson, one of the word's biggest providers of 5G equipment, teamed up on one early test with the Fraunhofer Institute for Production Technology in Germany.The experiment involved a factory that makes metal bladed disks for jet engines. The large components are made in a process called metal milling, which takes up to 20 hours to complete and requires extremely precise cuts to be made in metal components.The procedure has a high error rate: up to 25% of the blades have to be reworked because of faults caused by small vibrations. Often, mistakes are not detected until the end of the process, meaning much effort is wasted on completing flawed blades. But by placing sensors that use 5G directly on the components or tools, Ericsson was able to detect faults in real time and reduce the error rate to just 15%. The average production cost of a blade was reduced by \u20ac3,600 ($4,075).The speed and reliability of 5G networks means there is virtually zero latency, or lag time, between devices and the servers they communicate with. And that's what makes the technology so useful to manufacturers.With one millisecond latency, you can sense whether there is a deviation in the process before the tool even hits the blade and you can stop the machine before the error happens, said \u00c5sa Tamsons, a senior vice president at Ericsson.Nishith Tripathi, a mobile wireless technologies expert at Award Solutions, said that only 5G can deliver the performance needed in factory settings.4G can simply not do the job, you need the high speed and low latency of 5G to deliver this kind of application, he said.Two more features make 5G ideal for use in factories: The networks are relatively easy to install, and they can support a huge number of devices. Buildings the size of most factories can be virtually wrapped with a 5G network via an antenna placed on the roof. That's much easier than other potential 5G applications, such as self-driving cars, which would require a huge number of roads to be lined with 5G equipment.Tripathi said 5G technology also allows for a massive number of connections at the same time. If every piece of equipment in a factory needs to be connected, 5G networks can handle the burden. Ericsson isn't the only company that's experimenting with the technology. A Bosch factory in Worcester, England started 5G trials last month. And in Austin, Texas, Samsung is working with AT&T, CNN's parent company, to create a 5G manufacturing innovation zone.When you talk about 5G experiences like holograms, virtual reality, the things you and I will experience, we will have to wait a couple of years, but for businesses, it's now and here, said Tripathi."},

But it's already done major damage to the UK economy.The  to leave the European Union in June 2016 caused the pound to weaken dramatically and ushered in years of uncertainty that has reduced economic activity and triggered a slump in investment.The economy is now 2% smaller than it would have been if the United Kingdom had chosen to remain in the bloc, according to the Bank of England. The economic output lost since the referendum is worth about \u00a3800 million ($1 billion) per week, or \u00a34.7 million ($6 million) per hour.The economic consequences have piled up despite there having been no structural changes yet to Britain's trading relationship with EU nations or the rest of the world. Britain has continued to sell goods and services into the European Union, its biggest trading partner, while politicians worked to negotiate the divorce. It has been easy for UK companies to hire EU workers, and to maintain supply chains that crisscross national borders. Yet there has been no clarity over the terms of future UK trade for nearly three years, making it difficult for companies to plan for the future. Investments have been delayed or canceled and many businesses have instead poured millions into planning for the worst case scenario: a disorderly Brexit. With UK politics in disarray, there's still a risk the country will leave the European Union without a transitional deal to protect trade. The Bank of England has said the fallout from that scenario would be worse than the 2008 financial crisis.The United Kingdom was the fastest growing G7 economy when voters went to the polls in 2016. Emergency action by the Bank of England helped the UK economy avoid the recession that some had predicted would follow a vote in favor of Brexit, and unemployment remains very low.But the country still fell toward the bottom of the G7 ranking. Economic growth has slumped from an annual pace of around 2% to less than 1% now.Investment by UK companies stalled after the referendum and then plunged 3.7% in 2018. Meanwhile, the rest of the G7 has seen business investment grow around 6% a year since the vote. And business confidence in Britain has slumped. The reason for this underperformance relative to the rest of the world is, I believe, the uncertainty surrounding the prospect of Brexit, Gertjan Vlieghe, a member of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee, said in a speech last month. The pain has also been felt by households. The pound plunged 15% against the dollar after the 2016 vote, pushing the price of imported goods higher. That spurred inflation and contributed to a decline in the value of people's paychecks. Executives have reacted to the uncertainty by attempting to Brexit-proof their businesses.It is clear that political inaction has already had economic consequences, with many firms hitting the brakes on investment and recruitment decisions as a result of ongoing uncertainty, said Adam Marshall, director General of the British Chambers of Commerce, a business lobby.Many banks have set up new offices in Germany, France, Ireland and other EU countries to safeguard their regional business after Brexit. Financial services companies also have to move substantial assets there to satisfy EU regulators. Assets worth at least  are leaving the country, according to consultancy EY.  and   are both . Manufacturing companies, which need their supply chains to function seamlessly, have also made changes.   has  in the United Kingdom, citing uncertainty over Brexit. German engineering group   is shutting two of its three factories in Britain for the same reason.The most dangerous scenario \u2014 a disorderly Brexit \u2014 could still come to pass. EU leaders on Thursday granted the United Kingdom a short delay to Brexit, but the country could still crash out of the bloc unless UK lawmakers agree a path forward. Top officials at the Confederation of British Industry and the Trades Union Congress said Thursday that  if politicians allow that to happen. Firms and communities across the United Kingdom are not ready for this outcome. The shock to our economy would be felt by generations to come, they wrote in a letter to May.  and   joined with UK supermarkets to warn that crashing out of the European Union would disrupt supplies.

No airline is yet doing enough to reduce carbon emissions in the long term, but   and   are ahead of the pack when it comes to managing their greenhouse gas emissions and the risks related to climate change, according to a new report published on Tuesday. And Europe's   produces the lowest carbon emissions per kilometer traveled by a passenger, the report also found. The study by the Grantham Research Institute at the London School of Economics concluded that none of the world's 20 biggest publicly traded airlines is doing enough to tackle climate change. The research was funded by Transition Pathway Initiative, a group of investors with $13 trillion in assets under management that includes   and  .It said that the aviation sector must step up efforts to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases it produces, rather than rely on an offsetting mechanism that allows it to trade carbon emissions with other industries.In addition to Delta and United, the report called out Germany's   and Japan's  , as having gone the furthest on tackling climate change risks. Australia's  ,   and United scoredwell on carbon emissions, alongside EasyJet.But ANA scored badly on that measure, as did Korean Air and  . The report said factors such as the age of fleets, the mix of long and short haul flights, the amount of freight carried and the density of seats would all affect carbon emissions per passenger.United, Delta, Lufthansa and ANA have taken account of the risks climate change poses to their business in developing their corporate strategies, a step investors are increasingly demanding from companies across different industries. However, the study said only Delta and Lufthansa have gone as far as linking their climate change targets to executive pay, another .The aviation sector is doing the basics when it comes to carbon performance, but investors are urging them to take more significant steps as they judge which airlines are most likely to survive the turbulence of the transition to a low carbon economy, said Faith Ward, co-chair of the Transition Pathway Initiative.Korean Air,   and   were among the companies identified by the study as lagging behind on climate change strategy and long term targets. However, Southwest scored well on carbon efficiency. American said it was taking significant steps to reduce its carbon footprint. Some of the world's biggest airlines were not included in the study. That's because they are not publicly traded (Qatar Airways and Emirates), or because not enough of their shares are available to foreign investors ( ). The study also looked at whether airlines' current plans for carbon emissions reductions are in line with international pledges, such as the Paris climate accord. It said EasyJet was the only airline on track to meet those benchmarks after 2020.The airline sector currently accounts for 2% of global CO2 emissions. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) is expecting the number of air travel passengers to double to 8.2 billion by2037, which could mean higher emissions. A spokesperson for IATA said the association wants airlines to ramp up investment in new technologies that would make flying more efficient. However, he added that it's not just up to the airlines to become more efficient.The current air traffic control management system is outdated and needs modernizing. That would lead to more efficient routes, the spokesperson added. The industry is also arguing that airlines have to rely on offsetting in shorter term, because there is no technology that could replace the current fuels \u2014 unlike in the automobile industry which can increasingly rely on electrification.

{"title": "NASA considers sidelining its Boeing-built rocket for an upcoming Moon mission", "cate": "business", "content": "In the face of more frustrating delays with the rocket Boeing is building for NASA, the space agency will decide how to launch an upcoming Moon mission.NASA is expected to announce this week whether it will sideline its long-overdue rocket, Space Launch System, and instead use commercial launch vehicles. The space agency contracted Boeing in 2012 to build SLS's core components.NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine made a stunning announcement during a Senate hearing on March 13 that the space agency would weigh buying rockets like those made by SpaceX and United Launch Alliance.That consideration was necessary, he said, because SLS was facing new hangups that threatened to upend plans to launch its Orion spacecraft on an uncrewed test flight around the Moon in mid-2020.It was the first time an agency official suggested publicly that existing heavy-lift rockets could get the job done. The news emboldened critics who say NASA doesn't need to spend billions on SLS to reach many of its goals.But NASA is not abandoning its rocket. Bridenstine reiterated NASA's long-term commitment to SLS, saying it remained critical to US spacefight ambitions because of its size: The rocket would far out-power anything currently on the market and open up new opportunities such as landing people on Mars.For the sake of avoiding more embarrassing delays for Orion's upcoming test flight, however, Bridenstine said NASA would spend two weeks reviewing other launch options for that mission.The results are expected to be made public in the next few days, and it's not clear what NASA will decide.Boeing spokeswoman Patricia Soloveichik said Saturday that the company had some breakthroughs in manufacturing innovations and will be able to deliver its components on time. A NASA spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment over the weekend.NASA wants to eventually use SLS to launch humans into deep space for the first time in a half century. The rocket promises to be the mightiest ever built, able to produce up to  more thrust than the Saturn V rocket that powered the Apollo missions.Boeing started building the core stage, the backbone of the rocket, about seven years ago. Officials said SLS would be ready to fly the Orion capsule on its uncrewed lunar mission, dubbed EM-1, in December 2017.But that target was eventually pushed back to at least mid-2020. An oversight  published five months ago blasted Boeing's poor performance and said cost overruns are expected to double the company's expenses, to at least $8.9 billion, by 2022. NASA had already spent at least $11.9 billion on SLS. The space agency said at the time that it fully supports SLS and Boeing, and the program was showing major improvements in efficiency and management.But NASA officials were reportedly furious when they met with Boeing executives earlier this month. They said hangups could push SLS's debut into late 2021, according to the . (CNN Business was not able to independently verify the report. A Boeing spokesperson said she was unfamiliar with the conversations.)When Administrator Bridenstine faced Congress on March 13, he said more delays would be unacceptable and pledged to consider all options for launching EM-1 by the 2020 deadline.Certainly, there are opportunities to utilize commercial capabilities, he said, suggesting two heavy-lift rockets could be used in place of SLS. One rocket could launch Orion, he suggested, and another could launch the service module designed to power the capsule out to the Moon.That could lower the launch price: SLS will reportedly cost $1 billion per flight, while two SpaceX Falcon Heavy rockets could cost less than $200 million. But NASA would have to sink time and money into developing a way to mate Orion with its service module while in orbit.Two days after the hearing, Bridenstine said in a tweet that NASA and Boeing are working overtime to accelerate SLS development.If achievable, this is the preferred option for our first exploration mission, he said, though he added that NASA is still considering alternatives.If SLS is back on track, it would be welcome news for Boeing. News of more SLS delays were widely interpreted as another big blow for the company, which was already facing a  surrounding the 737 Max controversy.NASA is also  that Boeing is falling further behind on another multibillion dollar NASA contract: a spacecraft called Starliner that's designed to ferry astronauts to and from the International Space Station in low-Earth orbit."},
{"title": "Why Tesla needs Elon Musk", "cate": "business", "content": "The calls for Elon Musk to step aside as Tesla's CEO seem to be getting louder. Last month, the SEC requested that Musk be held in contempt over one of his tweets, and earlier this month, a  said the company would be just fine without Musk at the helm. Indeed, with each tweet, he seems to move closer to a breaking point. But replacing Musk with a seasoned executive at this point would likely risk Tesla losing its edge as one of the most disruptive forces that the auto industry has seen in decades. In 2003, if someone were to ask me the odds of a new US-based startup building a high-performance electric car for the masses and surviving more than 10 years, I would put them at nearly impossible. Because participation in the auto industry required significant capital and knowledge, and large, established firms controlled the distribution channels, it was difficult for startups to compete. And, established players had little incentive to innovate outside their core business. That left the industry sort of stuck with established players and incremental innovations over several decades. But Tesla defied the odds, and it has its controversial leader to thank.  Tesla's unique strategic choices underlie its trajectory of progress. Rather than first releasing models at low price points, as other automakers tended to do, it began with high-end models that fundamentally changed the perception of electric cars as glorified golf carts with short range and slow acceleration. It later moved to more affordable versions, like its . It also bypassed the established distribution network by selling its cars online instead of at dealerships and operating its own stores to generate awareness and excitement about Tesla's innovativeness. It opened up its portfolio of patented intellectual property to competitors. Unlike its much larger competitors, the company also preemptively built a battery manufacturing plant in the United States, costing , and a vast supercharger network worldwide. There's a good chance that Musk is the brains behind many of these decisions. Tesla is synonymous with Musk, both as an organization and as a brand. More importantly, Musk's judgment regarding the future of electric cars has become the blueprint for the entire industry. Many , such as BMW, Daimler and Volvo are pursuing fully electric cars, focusing on improving batteries and deemphasizing hybrid options. And Musk's hands-on approach from building the organization to designing and manufacturing the vehicles has provided him with a unique experience that is second to none in this business. Such a skillset is especially valuable at a time when the company is developing an electric car that's affordable enough for the masses. Any unforced error now can be extremely costly for Tesla and can open the doors for rivals that are finally accelerating their electrification efforts and are keen on gaining market leadership.Of course, not every aspect of Musk's decision-making represents . Consider the recent seemingly ad-hoc decisions around , the  of Solar City in 2016, which seems to have been of little benefit to Tesla, or his attempts at  last year. But that's probably a by-product of trying to do too much too quickly, and that too with an extreme level of self-confidence.Today, Tesla needs Musk more than ever \u2014 not because of what it has achieved but because of what he has promised. The reason Tesla enjoys a higher valuation with only a small fraction of the sales that many of its established peers see is because of the  that Musk has sculpted.   It's true that Tesla cannot compete with its established peers in terms of scale, but it can in terms of the pace of innovation. That is what Musk has always aspired to do, despite significant short-term scrutiny by investors and analysts. Not having him in the driver's seat will put Tesla at risk of losing its momentum as a disruptive innovator and succumbing to pressure to generate short-term cashflow instead of staying true to its long-term vision. Remember what happened to Apple after Steve Jobs was , only to come back in times of desperation more than 10 years later? He staged one of the biggest economic revolutions of the internet era and made Apple the most valuable company on the planet. Or consider  to Twitter after seven years, and leading a remarkable recovery despite facing formidable competitors and an environment of increasing distrust in social media.Pursuing unorthodox strategic decisions and long-term goals that come with lots of uncertainty and risk requires a unique leadership style: one that inspires people to implement a vision \u2014 no matter how farfetched it may seem \u2014 and carry out the mission despite significant challenges. This is what Musk excels at. It is no secret that he is the chief architect of the house of Tesla, and it will be his legacy. He inspires people by his passion for Tesla's mission and by underscoring its importance for our planet. His resolute hands-on approach to be involved at every level and for almost every task, while clearly stretching his own abilities and many of his colleagues', gives a sense for how deeply he cares about every aspect of what Tesla is about and should be known for. That, by itself, can be a strong enough motivation for many.Musk could certainly help himself and his team by finding a Sheryl Sandberg \u2014 someone he can trust and have by his side to share some of the demanding tasks on a day-to-day basis. This is also how he may be able to decouple exuberance from efficiency so that he can be remembered for not only being a disruptor but also a creator of a sustainable machine of disruption. Of course, having a co-founder as a CEO is a double-edged sword. While they carry the passion of creating a great company, along with a strong appetite for risk-taking, they may not be adept in juggling short- and long-term considerations, and in aligning with the different stakeholders. However, Tesla is not quite ready for a corporate operative yet. There is much more left to be done within Tesla's disruption-oriented agenda, especially at a time when the industry is in a nascent stage of electrification and autonomy. Getting rid of Musk is more likely to derail its competitive edge as a pioneer and a technology leader than to sustain its agenda of disruption. "},

We're about to find out.About  are eligible to vote in the election, which will take place over about , and many more of them are online than during the last election in 2014. The scope for social media to be abused to manipulate voters has never been greater. India is the world's biggest market for   and its messaging platform WhatsApp. It's also one of   most important markets. The country's vote will present these companies with their sternest test yet. Social media has faced increasing scrutiny over its role in elections ever since the 2016 US campaign, with Facebook in particular facing controversies like  using their platform to sway voters and data from millions of users being shared with research firm .In elections in Mexico and Brazil last year, and Nigeria earlier this year, the company stepped up its efforts to stop abuse, though there were  that WhatsApp was used to  before the Brazilian vote.India's electorate is bigger than the combined population of those four countries. The enormity of it is quite well defined, and that is one of the reasons we think it is also one of our top priorities to keep elections safe and secure in India, Shivnath Thukral, Facebook's public policy director in India, told CNN Business.We've been working for months and applying different learnings from different parts of the world to ... ensure that there is no abuse on the platform, he added. It won't be easy.Indian politics is often fought along social and religious lines, and recent years have seen an  under Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party. The concern is that social media could be used to deepen those divisions, particularly through misinformation around the elections, and trigger violence. As the election approaches, this is going to become more aggressive and there's always a chance that it can lead to loss of life or property, said , founder of Indian fact-checking website Alt News. In the heat of the elections, such kind of misinformation triggers any kind of violence, he added.WhatsApp, which has more than 200 million users in India, has already found itself at the center of the issue. Viral hoax messages on the platform were  last year, with the victims falsely accused of child abduction. , a professor of political science at India's Ashoka University, said that social media has become a constant megaphone for political parties to amplify their messages. When those tools are used as weapons, not so much for smear campaigns or political satire but when it's used as an instrument of social polarization ... the damage goes beyond the framework of the election, he added.The megaphone is irresistible.  has over , more than any world leader except President Donald Trump, while main opposition leader Rahul Gandhi has already built up a following of nearly 9 million since joining the platform in 2015.Social media in Indian politics burst onto the scene , when Modi in particular dominated the conversation. This time around, his rivals appear to be catching up. The narrative of who's up or who's down, who's smart and who's not ... that agenda gets set by social media in a way that TV was never doing before, said , author of India Connected and a former CNN India bureau chief. In the last election, social media was harnessed to get the message out. This time, the dangers are coming to the fore. Any information automatically generates counter-information, and any fake information generates counter-fake information, said Verniers. In a way, you could say that Indian political parties are very good at interfering with their own election. Facebook's Thukral downplayed suggestions that social networks are being weaponized.Of course there is a responsibility on us to make sure that the bad actors or the abuse of the platform is not becoming the bigger play. I would say that Facebook remains a platform where good ideas, good storytelling, good thoughts and ideas are being shared, he said.  The sheer scale of India's election presents a huge challenge for social media companies.In 2014, India had around 250 million internet users. More than 560 million people are now online. A fall of nearly 2,000% in the price of mobile data over the last two years, plus more affordable smartphones, have driven . But hundreds of millions of Indians experiencing the internet for the first time are not educated, leaving them vulnerable to misinformation. Owning a phone and owning an internet connection has become much more affordable and pretty much everyone who has a phone has WhatsApp now, so there's a much higher reach, says Pratik Sinha, founder of Alt News. At the same time the amount of internet literacy in large sections of the population is next to none.Alt News, founded two years ago, is one of several fact-checking websites that have launched since India's last election in 2014, as viral hoaxes on social media become a bigger menace.In the past month alone, the site has debunked a  being passed off as footage of Indian Hindus abusing Muslim women, a  that claimed to show drones Israel had sold to India, and  of fake news about the recent military clash between India and Pakistan. Much of the fake news that fact-checkers like Alt News unmask is , including Modi's  and the , led by Gandhi. I think political parties are motivated enough and have enough money that they will add more labor to ensure that the propaganda reaches the last person, said Sinha. I don't think there's anything that can be done as far as elections are concerned.Facebook and Twitter have taken several steps to make sure their platforms are not abused. WhatsApp is using artificial intelligence to  that spread problematic content, while Facebook is  and partnering with Indian fact-checkers. Twitter has announced  to crack down on bad-faith actors, and is also working with political parties and election authorities to ensure its platform isn't compromised during the polls. We deeply respect the integrity of the election process and are committed to providing a service that fosters and facilitates free and open democratic debate, Colin Crowell, Twitter's global public policy head, said in a statement in February. The 2019 [election] is a priority for the company, he added. Crowell recently appeared in front of an Indian parliamentary committee to testify about safeguarding citizens' rights online, as did his Facebook counterpart, Joel Kaplan. Facebook declined to comment on what was discussed, while Twitter did not respond to a request for comment. But Kaplan said in a statement after the hearing that he was grateful to the committee for the chance to show how we are preparing for the Indian elections and helping keep people safe.Political candidates will also be required to share details of their social media accounts with India's election authorities, Chief Election Commissioner Sunil Arora announced Sunday. Parties will also be required to get political ads on social media pre-approved by the Election Commission and declare how much they have spent on social media advertising.Facebook, Twitter, Google and YouTube have committed in writing to ensure that any political advertisement published on their platforms will be certified, Arora said.WhatsApp responded to last year's lynchings with several measures that it hopes will help during the election as well \u2014 labels on forwarded messages and an  on radio, TV and newspapers. The messaging platform also limited to five the number of chats a single message can be forwarded to.But each WhatsApp group can have up to 256 people, meaning a message can still reach 1,280 people at the touch of a button. The velocity that misinformation gets once something is out there and it is something which captures people's imagination, then it is shared like crazy, said Sinha. And it's that velocity that one needs to arrest, so that the least amount of people are affected.In many ways, the election will serve as a litmus test for how India's internet \u2014 second only to China's in size \u2014 will grow and progress in the future. The rapid boom in user numbers poses an ever greater challenge to the government and tech companies to keep them safe. The fact that all of this happening so quickly in India means that giant mistakes will be made and people will end up being misinformed in a mass way, said Agrawal.CNN's Sugam Pokharel contributed to this report.

{"title": "Boeing testing software changes to 737 MAX planes", "cate": "business", "content": "Pilots from the three American carriers that fly  planes tested software changes developed by Boeing to a key stabilization system on Saturday, a person briefed on the tests said.The changes are intended to decrease the chances of triggering the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, or MCAS, which is believed to have played a role in the Lion Air crash in October. The Federal Aviation Administration has said there are similarities between that crash and a  earlier this month in Ethiopia. Pilots and training officials from Southwest Airlines, American Airlines and United Airlines met with Boeing officials Saturday to review the software changes in the Seattle area, where the model is assembled, according to multiple airline sources.At the gathering, pilots from the three American carriers, plus two smaller non-US airlines, ran simulated flights designed to mimic the situation that brought down the Lion Air flight in Indonesia last year, using the current and updated software, according to the person briefed on the session.Each pilot using the flight simulator landed the plane safely, the person said. In the simulations with the current MCAS software, the test pilots used existing procedures to disable the system, while test flights using the new software required less intervention from the pilots, the person said.Saturday's test flights were . The updated software designed by Boeing uses input from two sensors on the nose of the plane, instead of one, and is designed to not trigger the MCAS system repeatedly, which is believed to have pitched the Lion Air plane's nose down so sharply that the pilots' attempts to regain control were futile.In a statement Sunday, Boeing called the meeting a productive session and said that they had invited more than 200 pilots and technicians, as well as regulators, to an informational session at the company's production facility in Renton, Washington, on Wednesday. This is part of our ongoing effort to share more details about our plan for supporting the safe return of the 737 MAX to commercial service, Boeing said.We had a productive session this past Saturday and plan to reach all current and many future MAX operators and their home regulators. At the same time, we continue to work closely with our customers and regulators on software and training updates for the 737 MAX, Boeing said. The FAA, which is part of this effort to test the new software, declined to comment.One source familiar with the tests said the FAA is expected to receive the software early in the week. But the FAA is not expected to allow the dozens of 737 MAX planes it grounded back into the air until it learns more about the causes of the Ethiopian Air crash, the source said.Data from the flight data and cockpit voice recorders is being analyzed in Ethiopia. US air carriers would like to see the plane return to the sky. American, which has 24 MAX aircraft in its fleet, and Southwest, which has 34, agree with union statements that their pilots are trained well enough to deal with the incidents that the Lion Air pilots encountered. American alone is canceling dozens of flights a day as a result of the grounding of the MAX aircraft. On Sunday, the airline said in a statement that the cancellations would continue through April 24, resulting in 90 flights grounded every day. "},
{"title": "Ethiopian Airlines is a symbol of national pride. Now a disaster has put it under scrutiny", "cate": "business", "content": "Ethiopian Airlines unveiled plans last October to build a mega-airport south of Addis Ababa. The new hub, it claimed, would handle 80 million passengers a year \u2014 the same  as Heathrow in London.Airlines don't normally build airports. But the project reflected the ambition of Ethiopian Airlines, which has turned itself into an aviation powerhouse in part by acquiring stakes in the national airlines of neighboring countries. Ethiopian Airlines generates billions of dollars in annual revenue and carried nearly 11 million passengers last year. Its fleet has grown to 111 planes, many of them new or just a few years old.The planned airport, near the city of Bishoftu, would help the airline prepare for another round of expansion. But earlier this month, Bishoftu was in the headlines for a different reason.Six minutes after taking off from Addis Ababa on March 10, Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 plunged into the earth near the lakeside city, killing 157 people and putting the airline under a microscope.Founded in 1946 by Emperor Haile Selassie, Ethiopian Airlines is older than most African countries. The state-owned carrier started life as a joint venture with now-defunct American carrier Trans World Airlines (TWA), using a fleet of ex-US military C-47 Skytrains that were leftover from World War II to rattle around the continent.As Ethiopia underwent radical upheaval in the following decades \u2014 including the fall of its monarchy, the reign of a brutal Marxist regime and a famine that killed an estimated  \u2014 the airline managed to survive. Flag carriers from bigger African economies, meanwhile, such as South African Airways and Kenya Airways, fell into bankruptcy or financial difficulty. Nigeria no longer even operates a national carrier.Zemedeneh Negatu, the global chairman of Fairfax Africa Fund who has advised Ethiopian Airlines, says the key to the airline's resilience is that it has always been run like a business with no interference from the government. Staffed by industry experts, the airline doesn't suffer from the same high turnover as its rivals. Tewolde GebreMariam, the current CEO, began his career with the airline in 1985.Its home nation's weak economy might also have been a blessing. Management has always been acutely aware that if they made losses, the government was not in a position to bail them out, says Elijah Chingosho, a former secretary general of the African Airlines Association and managing director of Ultimate Solutions Consulting.For decades, Ethiopian Airlines survived \u2014 but it wasn't until the mid-2000s that it started to thrive.In 2005, the airline made global headlines when it announced that it would be the launch carrier for the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, placing a $1.3 billion order for 15 of the fuel-efficient, long-range aircraft.Soon after, the airline began expanding its international network with a focus on emerging economies. One major target, China, is now one of the Ethiopian government's biggest economic partners.Everyone was belittling that strategy, says Negatu, who was born in Ethiopia. They now fly 40-plus flights a week to China and another 20 plus to India. Fifteen years ago, that strategy wasn't so obvious.Ethiopian Airlines would later sign code-share agreements with Lufthansa,   and Asiana Airlines. In 2011, the carrier joined the Star Alliance, which includes  , Air Canada and Singapore Airlines. The airline also operates Africa's , where pilots, ground staff, maintenance technicians and cabin crew from across the continent come to train.But its biggest innovation was still to come.Africa's skies remain largely unconnected.Only five countries have direct flights to more than 20 other African nations, according to the African Union. Ethiopia tops that list with about 30 flights to destinations on the continent.The European market is almost entirely liberalized, meaning you can fly from one market to another without any particular restrictions, says Oliver Clark of aviation website Flight Radar. Africa is not like that. In Africa, often it's quicker to fly through a hub in the European Union or Middle East. You just can't fly direct.An open skies treaty endorsed by 44 members of the African Union in 1999 failed to bring about meaningful change. In 2018, an African Union initiative with the same mission was signed onto by 28 member states \u2014 but not Ethiopia. Many countries in the region continue to charge some of the world's most expensive aviation fees and taxes.The African Union estimates that if just 12 key Africa countries opened their markets, 155,000 jobs would be created along with a combined $1.3 billion in additional gross domestic product each year for those nations. A lot of these African countries are quite wedded to the idea of having a flag carrier, says Clark. If you open up the skies to competitors they could be seen as a threat to your homegrown airline.Ethiopian Airlines has pursued its own strategy: a 15-year plan to dominate Africa's skies by acquiring minority stakes in other carriers.In 2010, it became a founding partner in Togo-based airline ASKY. Two years later, it helped establish Malawian Airlines. It replicated the strategy last year with airlines in Guinea, Chad and Mozambique.It's an extremely smart strategy, says Negatu. Ethiopia helps its partners with expertise and credit lines for new aircraft. Ethiopian Airlines brings its entire global infrastructure to these startups, he says.Ethiopian Airlines isarguably the biggest aviation brand in Africa.The rapon Africans is often that we can't build world-class institutions, says Negatu. Ethiopian Airlines defies that logic. It's a successful, billion-dollar company that competes globally every single day.For that reason, the crash of the airline's   737 Max earlier this month was felt deeply.A lot of mothers in Ethiopia cried as if they lost one of their own children, says Negatu, describing the company as a symbol of what we can do and what we can achieve.The crash also put the company's reputation and safety record into the spotlight. It has suffered three major crashes in 70 years.Investigators looking at this month's crash, however, are focusing on the Boeing 737 Max because a Lion Air flight using the same aircraft crashed in similar circumstances in October, potentially diverting criticism away from Ethiopian Airlines.The problem of questions over its safety record is not necessarily new.In terms of it being an Africa airline and there being an assumption that it is less safe than others, that's an issue that it would have had irrespective of the crash, says Clark.It's about challenging long-held perceptions, he says. But there are plenty of airlines that have suffered accidents and have moved on. I can see Ethiopian Airlines doing the same. \u200b\u200b"},

South African media group Naspers unveiled plans Monday to bundle its stakes in tech businesses including   into a new company that will be listed in Amsterdam. Naspers would float 25% of the shares in the new business, which it said would become Europe's largest listed consumer internet company. In addition to Tencent, the new company will include Naspers' stakes in Indian e-commerce startup , Russian internet business Mail.ru and German food delivery company Delivery Hero. The listing will present an appealing new opportunity for international tech investors to have access to our unique portfolio of international internet assets, Naspers CEO Bob van Dijk said in a statement. Listing the assets on the Euronext exchange in Amsterdam solves a problem for Naspers. Its stake in Tencent, which it bought for $32 million in 2001, was getting way too big for South African markets. Naspers said that institutional investors in South Africa had been forced to trim their holdings in the company because its weighting had ballooned to 25% of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, up from 5% five years ago.Tencent, the sprawling conglomerate that owns the WeChat messaging platform and a host of payment apps and mobile games, is one big reason behind the intense investor interest in Naspers.Naspers raised nearly $10 billion in March 2018 by reducing its stake in Tencent from 33% to 31%. The remaining investment is now worth $134 billion. While Tencent is by far its most successful investment, Naspers has made some other smart bets. In May 2018, it netted $1.6 billion from the sale of its 11% stake in India's e-commerce platform Flipkart, now owned by  . Naspers first invested in Flipkart in 2012.The media and tech firm said Monday that it would remain the largest South African company on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange even after the spin-off lists in Amsterdam."},

{"title": "Bayern fans to unveil statue of Kurt Landauer in memory of chairman who rebuilt club after the Holocaust", "cate": "sport", "content": "For a club so intent on making history, it is perhaps apt that Bayern Munich will at last honor one of the club's most important figures who helped lay the foundations for its future greatness.Some 86 years after he was forced out of office by the Nazi regime, Kurt Landauer's statue will take pride of place at S\u00e4bener Strasse, Bayern's state-of-the-art training facility on the land acquired for the club by the man himself in the aftermath of World War II.Sculpted by artist Karel Fron, the statue was the brainchild of the , which was established to protect his memory and as a vehicle for social change.Due to be unveiled in May, the statue cost 70,000 euros ($79,000), with the money raised through donations from fan groups as well as private donors.Kurt Landauer laid the infrastructure for all the multimillion dollar players that are at Bayern today, a Kurt Landauer Foundation spokesman told CNN Sport.On the one hand, it shows that there was a club before the golden period of the 70s when Bayern won three consecutive European Cups.But we also hope it means that people will now go and learn about how the Jewish people were persecuted under the Third Reich.For many football fans, Bayern has always represented success. A five-time champion of Europe, a winner of 28 domestic league titles and 18 domestic cups, the Bavarian club has been a powerhouse of German football for decades.And yet, it was not always like that. At the time of the Nazis taking power in 1933, Bayern had just won the league title for the first time in its history under a Jewish coach and Jewish chairman.That chairman was Landauer. Born into a Jewish family in 1884, Landauer began his time at Bayern by playing for the club's youth team.His career was cut short when he moved to Lausanne, Switzerland, to train as a banker before returning to Munich where he was elected as the club's president in 1913.But his tenure was soon interrupted after he was called up to serve in the German army in World War One.It was upon his return to the club in 1919 where he resumed his role as president that Landauer began transforming the club from an amateur set-up to a more progressive and forward thinking enterprise.Kurt Landauer laid the foundations to enable Bayern to become what it is today, club historian Fabian Raabe told CNN.He is probably one of the three most important people in the history of our club and that is remembered by the supporters.You have to remember, that before him, football had an amateur nature to it. He was an innovator and changed all of that. He made sure the players and coaches got paid properly.He was integral to the club's first title victory in 1932 and everything he built helped pave the way for where we are today.Just a year after Bayern's title victory under Jewish coach Richard Little Dombi, Landauer's tenure at the club came to an abrupt end with the rise of the Nazis.The Nazis branded Bayern a Jewish club and Landauer resigned from his position as anti-Semitic legislation began to affect the every day lives of Jews in Germany.Landauer lost his job at a publishing firm and was forced to seek employment at Rosa Klauber, a Jewish-owned laundry business.In 1938, the day after Kristallnacht -- the rampage of state-sponsored violence by the Nazi regime against Jewish communities -- which caused widespread looting and destruction of Jewish properties across Germany and Austria, Landauer was arrested and sent to Dachau concentration camp.Unlike many others, Landauer was fortunate. He spent 33 days in Dachau, his military service as a solider during World War I securing his release and enabling him to escape to Switzerland in March 1939.While Landauer spent the war years in relatively safety, his family was not so fortunate. His three brothers, Paul, Franz and Leo were all murdered by the Nazis and his sister, Gabriele, was deported and never seen again.When he did return, Landauer redoubled his efforts to make sure Bayern would be a more professional looking club, securing land for a training ground, advocating payment for players and ensuring the team could compete with its rivals until he left the role in 1951.His tale has enjoyed a renaissance in recent years. Raabe believes much of that has to do with the way public perception of football has changed since Germany hosted the World Cup in 2006.He believes that whereas football in places such as Britain has long been seen as part of the country's social history, the sport was seen more as entertainment in Germany.In the 1970s and 1980s there was little time for remembrance or history in Germany, Raabe said.It was really in the early 2000s and then after the 2006 World Cup that things began to change and young people started to ask questions about our history.Since then, numerous articles and documentaries on Landauer's life have become part of the club's folklore with fans adopting his legacy and publicly celebrating the club's Jewish background.I think that Landauer's story inspires because of the message it sends, Raabe says.He came back to the place where his family had been killed by the Nazis because he loved the club so much and fans are moved by that.They also feel that his legacy has helped make what this club has become and want to tell his story. The ultras are telling fans that they're proud to have a Jewish story and that if other people have a problem with that then they don't belong at Bayern.The club has embraced Landauer's story too, donating money to local Jewish club TSV Maccabi Munich to help build a field named after Landaeur in 2010. There was even an inauguration friendly gainst a Bayern all-star team. There is also an exhibition dedicated to Landauer at the club's Erlebniswelt museum. In  2014, Bayern ultra group, Schickeria, was awarded the prestigious Julius Hirsch Award for bringing Landauer's story back into the public's consciousness. The group established a yearly anti-racism soccer competition, known as the Kurt Landauer Cup, and brought banners and choreography into the stadium in his name.The award, which is awarded to clubs for fighting social exclusion, racism and anti-Semitism, is named after Julius Hirsch, a German Jewish international who died at Auschwitz.It's an important message to the football family that this was someone who made it back and did so with enthusiasm for the club, for the city of Munich where he was persecuted Michael Linninger of the foundation told CNN.It's a person to identify with at a time where football has changed a lot and those people to identify with are quite seldom. Landauer's story resonates at a time where anti-Semitic attitudes and attacks have increased in Germany.A CNN survey of seven European countries conducted in Germany, Great Britain, Sweden, France, Poland, Hungary, and Austria exposed the prevalence of anti-Semitism in 2018. In Germany, the poll found that 55% of those surveyed believed that anti-Semitism is a growing problem in Germany today.In addition, it also found that 40% of young German adults between the ages of 18-34 know little to nothing about the Holocaust.a journalist based in Germany who has reported extensively on German fan culture in football, believes the unveiling of the Landauer statue is most timely.It's very significant at this time in Germany when anti-Semitism is on the rise, it's actually football fans who are trying to fight and stand against it, Tamsut told CNN.It is much more significant than people here can realize, and I'm saying that as a Jew living in Germany, not just a journalist.Tamsut believes much of the credit should go to the Bayern supporters, particular the ultras, who he says have been steadfast in their commitment to preserving the memories of the Jewish members of the club who perished in the Holocaust.The fact Landauer brought Bayern its first league title was of huge significance but they've also celebrated the lives of other Jewish members of the club. When you see a choreography inside the stadium about a Jewish Bayern Munich member it makes you emotional.  The whole point of the choreography is to remind people that they have a responsibility and they need to act accordingly.In life, and now in death, Landauer and Bayern will now be inextricably linked.There is a quote often attributed to Landauer, highlighting his love affair with the club.FC Bayern and I belong together and are inseparable from each other.Now it seems that Bayern feels the same way at last."},

That is what happened Sunday when Real Betis fans stood and clapped Lionel Messi after the Barcelona star completed a brilliant hattrick in a resounding 4-1 win for the Catalans. Cries of Messi! Messi! Messi reverberated around the Benito Villamarin Stadium in Seville as the Argentine chipped in his third in the 85th minute for his 33rd La Liga hattrick, 45th for Barcelona and the 51st of his career. No, I can't remember that happening before. I am grateful, we are always treated well when we play here, Messi told reporters after being asked about the Betis fans' reaction. Messi's hattrick included a 20-yard free-kick, a toe-poke from a Luis Suarez backheel and then a chip from inside the box which went in off the crossbar. The win puts leaders Barcelona 10 points ahead of Atletico Madrid in the league with 10 games remaining. Even though the opposition concedes goals to Messi they can still enjoy this unbelievable era which he has created, they enjoy it too and today they recognized that, said Barca coach Ernesto Valverde, .It's significant that they gave him this ovation, it's an acknowledgment. Our rivals' supporters have to suffer him but they also appreciate him, because of the player he is.Leo's performance was extraordinary, he got three goals but he could have got four, that shows you how good he is.Messi, Barca's all-time leading scorer, enjoyed another milestone as the victory was his 477th for the club, surpassing Xavi Hernandez's record. With 29 La Liga goals this campaign, the 31-year-old is leading the way in the race for the Golden Shoe award which he won last season. Rival football supporters are not averse to applauding players on opposing teams.Juventus fans acknowledged the brilliance of Cristiano Ronaldo's bicycle kick when the Portuguese was playing for Real Madrid in a Champions League tie, while Brazilian Ronaldinho, then playing for Barca, was cheered by Real Madrid fans in 2005 and, likewise, Ronaldo by Manchester United supporters after he scored a hattrick for Real Madrid.

It would trump the $330 million 13-year deal the Philadelphia Phillies and Bryce Harper agreed last month and boxer Canelo Alvarez's $365 million 11-fight arrangement with sports broadcaster DAZN. Trout, 27, is a two time American League MVP, six-time winner of the silver slugger award and has hit 240 home runs in 1,065 games.Yet he tends to shy away from the limelight and has spent his entire career at the Angels after being drafted in 2009. His current contract was due to expire in 2020.Although Trout's prospective contract would be the biggest in terms of total value, it would likely fall short of the amount Alvarez looks set to earn in the same period.

Just really happy.He made his exit from right field to a roaring ovation and received hugs from his teammates and coaches. The tribute to the all-time great lasted a few minutes, culminating with Ichiro tipping his cap and waving to the crowd. He received a hug from another Mariners legend, Hall of Famer Ken Griffey Jr. Then he took a deep breath, scooped up his bats, glove and helmet and went to the team's clubhouse.For me, it doesn't get better than tonight, Ichiro said. Nothing can top what happened tonight for me.There was still the rest of a game to play, but his career was done. Ichiro has retired after 19 MLB seasons at the age of 45.

They mobbed him for autographs before the game.

He played in Japan from 1992-2000, winning three consecutive MVP awards and seven straight batting titles.When he made the move to Seattle in 2001 -- becoming the first Japanese position player to sign with an MLB team -- Ichiro emphatically made his mark. He went on to win the American League MVP and Rookie of the Year awards that year, becoming just the second player ever to win both honors in the same season.From 2001-2010, Ichiro won 10 consecutive Gold Glove Awards and made 10 straight trips to the All-Star Game.In 2016, he reached rare company in MLB history when he recorded his 3,000th hit.

Overall, he has 4,367 hits between his career in Japan (1,278) and the Major Leagues (3,089).Ichiro is one of seven players in MLB history with at least 3,000 hits and 500 stolen bases. The others are Lou Brock, Ty Cobb, Eddie Collins, Rickey Henderson, Paul Molitor and Honus Wagner.In addition to the Mariners, Ichiro played for the New York Yankees and Miami Marlins in his MLB career.Last season, Ichiro returned to Seattle and hit .205 in 15 games before he transitioned to the role of special assistant to the chairman for the club. He struggled in this year's spring training, going 2-for-25 in 12 games.The original plan from the beginning that was that we go to Japan and that was what was promised, Ichiro said.

Tayla Harris, a star forward for the Australian Football League women's side Carlton is captured in the air having kicked the first goal of the game in a match between her side, the Blues, and Western Bulldogs. The picture of the 21-year-old was posted on Australian broadcaster Channel Seven's AFL Facebook page, but what followed has become all too familiar -- repulsive comments of a sexual nature posted by trolls which have left the athlete herself saying she felt she had been sexually abused on social media. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison has called those responsible cowardly grubs.Speaking to reporters in Melbourne Thursday, he said: I think they're grubs. I think they're cowardly grubs, who need to wake up to themselves.Trolls on social media, they're nothing new these days, sadly, but I think what's horrible is those trolls tend to target women and they tend to be the target for an inordinate share of the abuse that happens online.Kelly O'Dwyer, federal minister for women, has also added her voice to the chorus of condemnation of the trolls, saying that she was disgusted by the comments. O'Dwyer -- and many on social media, including prominent Australian athletes -- also condemned Seven's handling of the situation, with the network initially deleting its post, citing reprehensible comments, only to later reinstate the photo with an apology. Erasing the picture, rather than moderating the comments, had caused even more damage, many argued on social media. On her Facebook and  pages, O'Dwyer said: @taylaharriss is a superstar. She should be celebrated for her talent and athleticism as we celebrate any male footballer. I'm disgusted by the trolling that has taken place.She also told Australian broadcaster Channel 10: I was pretty frankly disgusted by Channel Seven's response in actually taking down her picture rather than dealing with the trolls. Australia's celebrated Olympic champion tweeted: How this incredible image of Tayla Harris was (1) seen as negative and drew trolls to comment and (2) that the @7AFL took it down as a result ... ASTOUNDS ME!The network later reposted the picture, admitting that removing the photo sent the wrong message. What next for the AFL and the social media platforms? In an interview with  Wednesday, Harris called on the AFL and possibly the police to take action. If these people are saying things like this to someone they don't know on a public platform, what are they saying behind closed doors, and what are they doing? she asked. These people need to be called out by the AFL, yes, but also taken further. Maybe this is the start of domestic violence, maybe this is the start of abuse.The comments that I saw were sexual abuse, if you can call it that, because it was repulsive and it made me uncomfortable so as soon as I'm uncomfortable with something like that that's what I would consider sexual abuse on social media.So, whether it's Victoria police, whatever it is, need to at least contact these people, some sort of warning, Facebook delete them, something needs to happen. We can talk about it as much as we want but they're not listening and they are probably smiling about it.Speaking to reporters Wednesday, AFL chief executive Gillon McLachlan said: It's more a challenge with the platform, social media, because this is not an isolated incident.

The 71-year-old, ex-president of the Tokyo 2020 bid committee, was  last December by French prosecutors over corruption allegations relating to the 2020 bidding process.When asked whether his resignation had anything to do with the investigation, Takeda reiterated his innocence, saying: I have not done anything unfair and I will work on to prove my innocence.In a statement to CNN, the IOC said it respected Takeda's decision, adding: Our respect of this decision is even greater because he took this step to protect the Olympic Movement while the presumption of innocence, on which the IOC insists, continues to prevail.French prosecutors are investigating two payments made to a Singapore-based company called Black Tidings in July and October 2013.Details of the payments -- totaling 2.8 million Singapore dollars ($2 million) -- had emerged during a separate investigation into corruption and money laundering following revelations of widespread doping in Russian sport.Takeda acknowledged earlier this year that a sum had been paid to Black Tidings for fair compensation based on a consultant agreement.But he added at that time: I have explained there were no improper action that can be recognized as bribing has taken place. In 2016, it was announced that the bidding and  Olympic Games would be investigated by French prosecutors as part of a wider probe into corruption in athletics.The bidding and voting process for the 2016 Olympics concluded in 2009, with Rio seeing off competition from Madrid, while Tokyo was awarded the 2020 Games ahead of Istanbul and Madrid. Japanese authorities deny knowledge of any illicit payment and Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga has said that it would abide by any investigation by French authorities.The Tokyo 2020 Bidding Committee defended the funds, saying it paid an amount for professional services. It said the services included consultation work,  planning of the bid, tutoring on presentation practice and service for information and media analysis.  "},

{"title": "America's Cup: Wipeouts and wizardry mark covert design battle", "cate": "sport", "content": "Science, secrecy and subterfuge have become as much a part of the America's Cup scene as the sailing itself.Two years out from the 2021 America's Cup in New Zealand's Auckland, this covert phase of design and testing is in full swing, with teams working feverishly to dream up a speed machine capable of winning the Auld Mug.The boats for the next edition of sport's oldest international trophy will be radical 75 feet long foiling monohulls -- dubbed AC75s -- which means they will lift out of the water on canting hydrofoils to fly at speeds of up to 50 knots.The concept is cutting-edge, and a departure even from the high-tech foiling catamarans that made up the last two editions of the Cup. With the first action not scheduled until the autumn, D-day for the launch of the teams' first of two race boats is March 31. The favorite mantra in Cup circles these days is, The only thing you can't buy is time.  But it's at times like these that the Cup can potentially be won or lost. Or possibly even changed forever.New design, technology and innovative thinking is the cornerstone of the Cup. From wooden hulls to carbon fiber; from the revolutionary winged keel that helped Australia II snap America's 132-year stranglehold on the competition in 1983, to giant foiling catamarans, control systems powered by cyclists, speeds in excess of 40 knots and real-time performance data pouring into chase-boat computers, each edition pushes the boundary.Some gains are incremental. Some represent giant leaps forward.Two years out from the 2013 competition in San Francisco, one of the challengers Team New Zealand was working secretly on a concept that took the Cup into a new realm -- the air.Away from prying eyes in Auckland, the team was conducting covert experiments to see if they could get a small catamaran -- which they nicknamed the Waka -- to rise up on foils when towed across the flat Lake Arapuni in Waikato. To anyone walking the dog around the lake, we probably just appeared like a few old battlers towing a beat-up old catamaran down the lake for fun, Team New Zealand's Australia skipper Glenn Ashby said on the team's website recently.After weeks of experimentation, the dream of souping-up their AC72 catamaran was becoming a reality.Foiling wasn't new in sailing, but getting a giant America's Cup multihull, which weighed the same as five saloon cars, to lift out of the water on a hydrofoil the size of a kitchen table -- and then racing it -- certainly was.Some of those evenings where we would sit around the table, knowing we were pioneering absolutely new ground in the America's Cup and in foiling multihulls and foiling boats was a pretty special feeling, added Ashby. Sitting there with the designers and the sailing team really knowing that you were part of such a special period of America's Cup history in the making. News of the Kiwis' eventual breakthrough spread like wildfire, and the other teams had to scramble to catch up. Team New Zealand may have ultimately lost 9-8 to Oracle Team USA in what was labeled one of sport's greatest comebacks, but they changed the face of the sport.  Their design bods were at it again on the AC50 boat in Bermuda in 2017, which had cyclors turning the winches with their bigger leg muscles, and they clinched the Cup in style.As winner, the Kiwis got to choose the boats for the next edition in conjunction with Italy's Luna Rossa, the principal challenger. But mindful of potential ingenuity, the Kiwis have even stipulated that for 2021 crew .... So cyclors are out in an effort to return to a more traditional sailor-oriented competition.To get a head start in this Cup cycle, Britain's Ineos Team UK and new US challenger  have built scaled-down foiling test boats to begin to understand the challenge of sailing the complex AC75.   Ineos, backed to the tune of $140 million by Britain's richest man, petro-chemicals billionaire Jim Ratcliffe, has adapted a 28-foot Quant yacht by attaching foils on canting arms and has been trialling it on the Solent on the south coast of England.Skipper and team principal Ben Ainslie said the boat -- dubbed T5 -- was pretty wild and told the Yacht Racing Podcast there have been some pretty big wipeouts as they learn the craft while the 40-strong design team works on the first version of the team's AC75. There's been a lot of swimming, he told CNN.It's an open secret that the teams have spies watching their rivals' every move, and Ainslie admitted there's certainly been quite a lot of reconnaissance, as you would understand. Over in Florida, American Magic, a new syndicate for 2021 bankrolled by businessmen Hap Fauth, Doug DeVos and Roger Penske, has been busy trialling its own scaled-down test boat. The team has revamped a 38-footer, dubbed the Mule, and has been testing on the flat waters of Pensacola in the northwest of the state. The evolution started out the first day I was on the boat and we foiled. It was quite windy, some of the systems weren't operating perfectly and the boat was a bit loose and were we a bit out of control, skipper Terry Hutchinson told the Yacht Racing Podcast.It was almost like getting into a car with my 16-year-old son driving for the first time. Just wondering what could possibly go wrong.Cup veteran Hutchinson describes sailing the Mule as an unbelievable experience and some of the most fun I've ever had sailing.The sensation of speed is impressive. I've spent the better part of a month sailing around at 30-something knots and it's becoming normal, he added.But every single day the guys are coming off the water with more questions than answers.The bulk of New Zealand's early testing has been done on a state-of-the-art virtual sailing simulator with sailors and designers working hand in hand, an innovation pioneered for Bermuda by technical director Dan Bernasconi's six-year stint with the McLaren Formula One team. They do, however, , too. In Italy, Luna Rossa have also been using a simulator allied to testing on a small foiling catamaran, mainly to work on concepts for the new double mainsail. Certain elements of the AC75 are one-design, meaning they are built centrally in Auckland so all the teams have the same equipment. The foil arms and canting systems are part of that package to save on design time and costs.Racing may be some months away, but for the America's Cup teams the design battle is raging.  If we don't have a fast boat I'm quite certain it doesn't matter how well we race a slower boat, we're not going to win so we have to make sure we work hard on developing a fast boat, added Hutchinson."},

This week, I made comments that were out of touch and insensitive, making a bad situation worse, the statement said. They made it seem like I was marginalizing David Ortiz and his financial situation, which was not my intention. I read them again and cringed. That is not who I am and not what I want to represent. My entire Tour career, I have tried to show respect and positivity. I let myself, my family, my partners and those close to me down, but I also let David down. I plan to call David tonight, something that is long overdue, to apologize for the situation he has been put in, and I have made sure he has received the full total that he has requested.Kuchar also said he'll donate money back to the event to be distributed to charities. For my fans, as well as fans of the game, I want to apologize to you for not representing the values instilled in this incredible sport. Golf is a game where we call penalties on penalties. I should have done that long ago and not let this situation escalate.The caddie of a winning golfer on the PGA Tour can expect to receive about 10% of his earnings. Ortiz knewthat because he wasn't Kuchar's regular caddyhe wouldn't receive that much, but he wanted more than the $5,000 Kuchar paid him. After Ortiz, known locally as El Tucan, had complained, Kuchar pushed back.I kind of think someone got in his ear, Kuchar told GOLF.com on Wednesday. I was very clear and very upfront on Tuesday [the first day of the tournament] and he said 'OK.' Kuchar said that he would pay Ortiz $4,000 if he came inside the top 10. The extra $1,000 was a bonus. Those were the terms. He was in agreement with those terms. That's where I struggle. I don't know what happened, Kuchar said.Ortiz told GOLF.com that Kuchar's camp eventually offered him an extra $15,000 -- taking his total to $20,000 -- but Ortiz turned it down as he felt it didn't match his own valuation.Ortiz typically makes up to $200 a day as a caddie at El Camaleon Golf Club, Playa del Carmen, where November's Mayakoba Classic was held.Kuchar's regular tour caddie, John Wood, was unavailable for the tournament.CNN's Matias Grez contributed to this report."},
{"title": "Tracy Edwards: 'Maiden was either met with antipathy or aggression'", "cate": "sport", "content": "In 1989, Tracy Edwards would have recoiled at the thought of being a feminist. It was such a dreadful word then, explains the sailor, who that year made history and defied critics by leading the first all-female crew to sail around the world. Had Edwards not been expelled from school -- for smoking and drinking during a school trip -- she may have never discovered her love of sailing and become the trailblazer she is today.Unbelievably, it was Edwards' well-traveled mother who suggested she pack her bags and go traveling to get some life experience abroad -- and alone -- after she was left without a degree.My mom was an extraordinary woman and she could see very clearly where I was headed and the direction I was carrying on, Edwards tells CNN Sport.She realized I needed to go away from where I was and kind of make many mistakes and find my way.It was in Greece where Edwards, aged 17, began working on charter yachts.I found my feet and realized that I'd felt contained before and it gave me the freedom to discover what I wanted to do, she says. Every boat I worked on had a great skipper who was a mentor and a ragtag bunch of crew members who I realized were like me.I didn't realize there were people like me and I felt like I fit in for the first time in my life, that no one really cared about anyone's background or why we were there.Fast forward 10 years and Edwards noticed the significant lack of women around her at sea. She was a young cook and the only woman on-board South African boat Atlantic Privateer during the 1985-86 Whitbread Round the World Yacht Race -- now known as the Volvo Ocean Race.Out of the 230 crew in the race, four of us were girls, Edwards remembers. It was at this point that she began asking herself, I wonder if girls could do it?It was only then, when Edwards began looking at creating an all-female crew, that she says she had her first real experiences of sexism or misogyny.I had never been told before that I couldn't do something -- mostly because I was where I should be -- in the galley, Edwards says as she rolled her eyes.But that was the reaction! I think if the reaction hadn't been so strong I'd probably moseyed through it but it made me thing 'whoa, what's going on?'After mortgaging her house in 1987, Edwards bought a dilapidated sailing yacht, Prestige, and brought it back to the UK where she, and her crew, began working on it.We had no money so we were just a bunch of girls with tools, Edwards laughs. No hard hats, no health or safety -- flip flops and shorts, wandering around with chainsaws.She says they were the talk of the boatyard. Nobody had ever seen a bunch of girls working in a boatyard so there was a lot of 'do you want help with that love?' Edwards laughs.Over six months, Edwards and her team pulled the yacht apart, redesigned it and rebuilt it from scratch.The best thing about doing it was we knew every inch of her -- we laid every cable, every pipe, we put every single thing in. We did everything ourselves.Even after rebuilding what became to be known as Maiden, the all-female crew continued to face sexism within the industry.Maiden was either met with antipathy or aggression -- not really much in between, Edwards says. As we got more successful it got worse -- they did not like that at all.And successful they were, Maiden finished second in its class during the 1989-90 Whitbread -- winning two of the legs. It was the best result for a British boat in 17 years -- and still remains the best result for an all-female crew.It was an historic moment that shocked the sailing world. It was also here that she noticed her views on feminism slowly changed.I realized that one of my early interviews one of the journalists question me 'are you a feminist' and I go 'oh God - no, no, no.' ... but then later on I noticed I (started) saying 'yes I am because I believe in equality.'After the race in 1990, Edwards sold Maiden and the 12 crew members scattered across the globe.Though with triumphs, came defeats. Edwards began managing sailing programs and created the Oryx Quest in 2005 -- the first round the world race to start and finish in the Middle East. The race sent Edwards bankrupt, after the Qatari sponsor failed to pay up its \u00a36 million sponsorship. Recovering from that is very hard, Edwards said.It was something that happened to me that I couldn't prevent. I would have never chosen to go down that route; It was a defining moment in my life.It was hard, I left home with nothing at the age of 15 and had done very well for myself by the time I was 36 and then lost it all by the time I was 43. It's a very difficult landscape when you're 43 years old and you think 'I've got to do that again.'You realize that when you're younger you have no fear -- you haven't failed yet. You have that overwhelming feeling that 'of course I'm going to succeed.'Edwards went on to work for the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Center and returned to university to complete a psychology degree.It's something I'd never have done if I hadn't of been disillusioned with the sailing world. I helped write the 2009 resolution on the UN Convention of the Rights of the Child which is not something I had planned to do!Then, in 2014, Maiden reentered Edwards life -- after she found out it was rotting away in the Seychelles -- an archipelago of islands in the Indian Ocean off East Africa.She'd been there for two years already -- unbelievable, Edwards says. This man who left her there didn't tell me.Members of the public who recognized Maiden as the yacht that sailed into the history books in 1990 contacted Edwards to tell her of the yachts' dilapidated state. It was when a naval officer reached out to her and said they were talking about deep-sixing it that she knew she had to do something, so she turned to crowdfunding and in 2016 repurchased Maiden.She was in the water, not lifted out or anything, and they hadn't really looked after her. We beat them down on the price a lot when we got there and thought 'this is actually a wreck, this is no longer a boat.'Bringing her back was just awful because we were looking at our work -- our names were still on the lockers, the navigation station was just like I'd walked out and left it -- it had all the old equipment.Maiden returned to Southampton, on the south coast of England, where a year-long restoration began -- in the very same shed where Edwards and her crew back in 1989 worked on the yacht before the Whitbread race. Edwards and Maiden is also the subject of a feature length documentary, directed by BAFTA award-winning director Alex Holmes.Edwards has embarked on new chapter of her life -- this time with  -- a not-for-profit organization that involves Maiden going on a three-year world tour to raise money and awareness for girls' access to education. The tour began in September.Edwards says it dawned on her when she was completing her degree that she was privileged enough to live in a country where education was available to all.I was handed an education on a plate (at 15) and I decided 'no, I already know everything and I'm just going to throw that back in your face.'According to UNESCO estimates published in 2016, 130 million girls between the ages of six and 17 are denied an education.The whole focus (of The Maiden Factor) is empowerment of women, celebrating where we got to and recognize how to get a bit further forward, Edwards says. In early August she also walked away with the  for her efforts and for championing the role of women in sailing.Everything about it feels really good, Edwards says of the three-year world tour. Maiden is inspirational, she changed my life and I think most of the crew would probably say the same thing.We can inspire other women and girls and get people involve and very visibly demonstrate something no one believed in.Almost 30 years after she and her crew made history, Edwards says she's only now beginning to appreciate everything she's accomplished.For the first time in my life I'm proud of everything we achieved, she says, and it's taken me a lot time to get there."},

{"title": "Madrid in Motion win $3.4 million GCL Super Cup in Prague", "cate": "sport", "content": "With $3.4 million on the line in the finals of the GCL Super Cup at the inaugural GC Playoffs, Eduardo Alvarez Aznar kept a cool head.Riding Rokfeller de Pleville Bois Margot in the second round on Sunday, the Spaniard calmly steered his horse around the course, finishing with just one time fault.It was enough to bring home the first GCL Super Cup for Madrid in Motion, who finished with a total of 11 penalties, six clear of Valkenswaard United and 15 ahead of Paris Panthers.That moment I was not thinking about the money, Alvarez Aznar said. I was thinking of the job my team mates did, they make me a little bit of pressure, but OK, I had to go a clear round, and I did it.     Alvarez Aznar's Dutch team mates, Holland's Marc Houtzager and Maikel van der Vleuten, celebrated wildly in a packed O2 arena after clinching what had been billed as the ultimate showdown.When the last rider, Eduardo, had to go, it was pressure, said Madrid in Motion team manager Eric van der Vleuten. It was unbelievable top sport.After three rounds over three days, the finals of the 16-team GCL Super Cup were contested between six teams: Madrid In Motion, Scandinavian Vikings, Paris Panthers, Valkenswaard United, Montreal Diamonds and London Knights --  the winner of the 2018 Global Champions League.Unlike the previous two rounds, no horse or rider substitutions were allowed on Sunday. Instead, three riders jumped two rounds, with all faults counting towards their total. That format produced high drama right from the start, when the first two teams, Montreal Diamonds and London Knights, were eliminated back-to-back. The Diamonds crashed out after Belgium's Jos Verlooy fell on the last fence, while the London Knights were knocked out of contention when Ben Maher's Explosion W twice refused to jump a steep wall. Maher, the team manager of the Knights, had put himself in the team for the finals, replacing Belgian Nicola Philippaerts.There had also been disappointment for Maher and Explosion W, the 2018 overall LGCT individual champions, during Saturday's Super Grand Prix, with the pair finishing in fifth place behind eventual winners Edwina Tops-Alexander of Australia and California.Maher later said his horse, who is relatively young at nine years of age, had been a bit spooked by some parts of the vast, sandy arena on Saturday night.  After a shock start to the GCL Super Cup, order was swiftly restored by Valkenswaard United, the overall GCL winners of 2017, who were in pole position going into round two with a double clear for Germany's Marcus Ehning and Ireland's Bertram Allen -- as well as eight penalties for Alberto Zorzi. Madrid in Motion, also on eight penalties, were in second place at more than six seconds back, with Paris Panthers third with 16 penalties, followed by Scandinavian Vikings in fourth and last place with 24 penalties. Starting in reverse order in the second round, Valkenswaard United's three riders added nine more faults to finish at 17 penalties. With two fences in hand, and the last team to go, the pressure was now on for Madrid in Motion. The arena went quiet as Houtzager and his horse Sterrehof's Calimero calmly jumped clear, taking the total to nine penalties after one time fault. Maikel van der Vleuten and Verdi TN had the same strategy, adding one time penalty with a controlled clear round. With the team now at 10 penalties, it was down to the final rider, Alvarez Aznar, to bring home the trophy. Very happy, Alvarez Aznar said. The first time, this competition. It was beautiful to ride and a fantastic atmosphere here.Houtzager paid tribute to his horse and his team mates.Calimero jumped super in the second round, from the first fence already, a top feeling, said Houtzager.

{"title": "Epaillard edges champion Maher to clinch Global Champions Tour opener in Doha", "cate": "sport", "content": "Julien Epaillard edged out defending champion Ben Maher by a whisker to win the first leg of the Longines Global Champions Tour in Doha.Epaillard, of France, and his horse Usual Suspect d'Auge raced to victory by producing a clear round in the jump-off in a time of 40.11 seconds, just 0.44 seconds faster than Britain's Maher and Explosion W, the overall circuit winners in 2018. It's crazy for me, today, Epaillard said in a televised interview, after riding away with prize money of \u20ac123,750 ($140,733). Normally I have another horse to ride the Grand Prix today, but he had a little thing and then I changed my plan, he said. I ride him today and I was so surprised for the first one to be clear. And then at the jump-off, only five riders, I say, OK, try the best. And it worked today. It's nice.Now in its 14th year, the Longines Global Champions Tour, along with the Global Champions League, is recognized as show jumping's richest circuit. It has expanded to 20 legs this season, with new stops added in New York, Stockholm and Montreal. Held in the vast, sandy arena at the state-of-the-art Al Shaqab Equestrian Facility in Doha, the season opener attracted 50 riders and 99 horses. Uliano Vezzani's challenging course over jumps as high as 1.6 meters saw only five riders qualifying for the jump-off on a clear, cool night in Doha.As the first rider in the jump-off, Epaillard and Usual Suspect d'Auge, an 11-year-old French-bred gelding, set the pace, going clear in a time of 40.11 seconds. With the next two riders, Italy's Alberto Zorzi and Holland's Frank Schuttert, both dropping a pole, Belgium's Nicola Philippaerts and H&M Chilli Willi played it safe as they produced a clear round in 43.43 seconds. I just tried to go quick enough and tried to stay clear and be on the podium, Philippaerts said in a news conference.The last to go, it was all in Maher's hands as he guided Explosion W over the fences at a rapid pace, only to come up short in the last turn into the final stretch.Watching from the warm-up arena, Epaillard clenched his fist and let out a roar when he saw Maher's time.Just misjudged it today, he's naturally very fast and we just weren't good enough to beat Julien today, said Maher, who won in Madrid, Paris, Rome and Doha on Explosion W last season. Today he was very fast. That's sport, and that's the way it goes. Epaillard had finished in second place no less than three times earlier in the week in Doha.I was not thinking, really, to win the Grand Prix, Epaillard said. It's fantastic, the horse is amazing. It's his second Global Champions League Grand Prix, he already won in Paris, and now here, I am very happy to ride him.His win in Doha means Epaillard is the first rider of the 2019 season to secure a spot in the lucrative Super Grand Prix in Prague, at the end of the season in November. It feels very good, said the Frenchman. Prague is an amazing place, I had a chance to ride there last year, it was a super show and already exciting to ride there.Earlier on Saturday, the two-day Global Champions League (GCL) team event was won by Shanghai Swans, with Germany's Daniel Deusser and Switzerland's Pius Schwizer both producing a double clear.Valkenswaard United finished second while New York Empire were in third place. We have a very good team, but still in the end you have to get the job done, Deusser told the GCL website. We had a strong day on Thursday, and two clear rounds today -- I have a super partner with Pius, so we're very happy.With 16 teams of six riders each, one more than last year, the competition will be fierce this season.I expected more teams on a double clear today, but it showed the course was tough, said Deusser. There were faults everywhere. It's a long season, but the first step is done so we hope to continue like this, he added.Very proud of my horse, how he jumped today, Schuttert, of Valkenswaard United, said. Hopefully, next time we can climb one spot up.London Knights, last year's overall Global Champions League winners led by former Olympic champion Maher, finished in fifth place in Doha, just behind Madrid in Motion, who had triumphed in the first-ever GCL Super Cup at the GC Prague Playoffs in December.

We didn't have enough money in our family to be part of a country club so it was huge for us to be able to play on a public golf course,  Woods said in a film for the Chicago Parks Golf Alliance. To build a public golf course in Chicago is as good as it gets. You can see the skyline, it feels right down the road. It is truly amazing. We have the opportunity to create something so special.Woods, who will be 43 on December 30, has teamed up with NBC golf commentator Mark Rolfing, who is head of the Chicago Parks Golf Alliance. The project is working in tandem with former US president Barack Obama's proposed Obama Presidential Center, which is set to be sited in Jackson Park, subject to federal approval.

{"title": "US Ryder Cup chiefs name Steve Stricker as captain for 2020", "cate": "sport", "content": "It was sent home humbled and in disarray after a heavy defeat by Europe in Paris, but the US Ryder Cup set-up has moved to avenge the loss by appointing Steve Stricker as captain. The 51-year-old, a non-playing vice-captain to Jim Furyk in the  in September, will lead a new-look US side against Europe and its new skipper Padraig Harrington at Whistling Straits, Wisconsin in 2020. Stricker appeared in three Ryder Cups as a player, winning at Valhalla in 2008, before losing both in 2010 at Celtic Manor and in 2012 at Medinah. Truly, it's a dream come true and an honor to represent the PGA, Stricker told a news conference in Milwaukee. Truly a dream come true, an honour to represent the PGA, the competition itself, truly humbled by this opportunity because I'm very passionate about this competition.We want to win this more than ever and I'm here to help in any way I can. The appointment of Stricker, a Wisconsin native, comes as little surprise.The former world No.2 is viewed as a popular figure within the game and well placed to get the best out of close friend Tiger Woods, who was out of sorts in Paris despite having just won the Tour Championship for his first title in five years.One of Stricker's main tasks will be to unite a team that left France under a cloud after and rumors of a bust-up between Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka.Stricker, who served as a vice-captain to Davis Love III when the US comfortably beat Europe at Hazeltine in 2016, wasted no time in naming Furyk as his first vice-captain. The 12-time winner on the PGA Tour further boosted his credentials for the role when he captained Team USA to a 19-11 win over Nick Price's international team at the 2017 Presidents Cup in New Jersey. Stricker, the first US captain without a major title, will also act as vice-captain to his Woods at the 2019 Presidents Cup event in Melbourne in December.Speaking to the media ahead of Thursday's World Golf Championship event in Mexico, Woods said of Stricker: He was the overwhelming choice by all of us on the committee. All of us felt it was his time, he was deserving, what he has done as a vice-captain in the Ryder Cup and captain in the Presidents Cup has been tremendous and we just thought with his leadership and the way the guys follow Stricks he would be the best captain there is for 2020, and the players were unanimous and want him as their team leader.   Everyone knows he is such a nice guy but beneath that is this fieriness and competitiveness and he is one of the most detail-oriented guys we know of. He'll be understanding and is very good at communicating with the players and getting their opinion but good at putting his foot down when he has to.When the Ryder Cup gets under way on September 25 next year, Stricker will be looking to arrest the US team's losing streak of seven losses in the last nine events.Not since 1959, when the tournament was contested by the US and Great Britain, has the American team regained the trophy at the first time of asking after losing the previous contest.However, a good omen for Stricker is that both of his country's victories since 2000 have come in the US."},
{"title": "Cheltenham Festival: A day in the life of Paul Nicholls' racing yard", "cate": "sport", "content": "It's lunchtime at Manor Farm Stables and stable star Clan Des Obeaux wants his carrot, and he wants it now.Tall, dark and handsome, his coat glistening in the unusually warm February sun, the French-bred bay gelding pricks up his ears as Clifford Baker, the head lad, tickles his soft nose and hands him his favorite vegetable.He just is special, he's won some big races, Baker told CNN Sport at the yard in Ditcheat, a small village in the rolling hills of Somerset, England. And you're friendly, aren't you? And you like carrots.The seven-year-old Clan Des Obeaux, who is partly owned by former Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson, is one of the standouts of the racing yard owned by Paul Nicholls, the 10-time champion jumps trainer.With more than 3,000 wins, including four Cheltenham Gold Cup victories and one Grand National, Manor Farm is one of the most successful stables in National Hunt racing.  Green boards with gold lettering adorn each box, listing the achievements of the inhabitants or famous former stars. The stable's biggest names have been 1999 Cheltenham Gold Cup winner See More Business,  2007 and 2009 Gold Cup champion Kauto Star, next door neighbor Denman, who won the showpiece in 2008, and 2012 Grand National winner Neptune Collonges. Nicholls, a former jumps jockey, began the yard in 1991 with eight horses. The operation now consists of two yards in Ditcheat, where up to 50 staff train and look after 128 racehorses.As head lad of 23 years, Baker has played a crucial role in its success. He lives next to Manor Farm, and is always the first to arrive and the last to leave.Here's an average day at Manor Farm Stables from Baker's perspective:  I come in to give all the horses their breakfast, and make sure they are all OK. I do that on my own, most head lads would do that. Their feed is basically a bowl of cubes, which contains everything they need. After I feed them, all the staff get in. Everyone mucks out, usually five or six horses each, and gives them fresh water.When everything is mucked out, me, Paul (Nicholls) and Harry Derham (assistant trainer) will have sorted what we call the work list, which will have every horse on it, and then decide what exercise that horse is going to do for that day. It can be a variation of half a dozen different things that we do.If it's a race day, it will all depend on where you are going and what you are doing. They get fed the same, first thing in the morning, and they normally go on the walker for an hour in the morning.We can leave anytime between 5 a.m. in the morning, if you are going up north, or 9 a.m. if you are local. But basically, if they are racing, their morning will be to have breakfast and then a walk, that's the aim. And then they go on the lorry with their member of staff that looks after them. Each person looks after about five horses.   The first lot go out, for just over an hour. This can be galloping, cantering, schooling, or going for a walk. They come back in, and then we all have a short break, 15 minutes or so, for our own breakfast.The second lot will ride out. The third lot will ride out. The horses will get fed again, the same thing they had in the morning. And they will have had a basket of hay in the morning as well.A vet will come in once or twice a week, and we have physiotherapists coming in two or three times a week. They will give them a massage, or tweak anything that needs tweaking, just like they would with us humans.    We stop for lunch, everybody goes home and the horses relax and eat their lunch. The staff come back from their lunch break, and then it's mucking out again, grooming, put some of the horses on the walker, which will be about an hour.The horses have another feed, their last thing that night. They get two bowls, plus a few extras, a bit of chaff and a supplement. They are all tucked up, ready to go to sleep.Life in a racing yard is relentless, with no shortcuts.But on this sunny morning, Nicholls and Baker are taking time out to present Gold Cup contender Clan Des Obeaux and other Cheltenham Festival entries to dozens of British media personnel.It's a chance to see the horses in their natural surroundings, and chat to Nicholls, Baker and the stable staff in a relaxed environment.All too soon the cameras and notebooks will be gone and the yard returns to its daily rhythm.Training winners is the name of the game, and for Baker, their success is built on a number of factors. It is motivation and determination to do well, he said. We are obviously good at what we do. We get horses very fit, they jump well, and we train good horses. It's a lot of things pulled together. You've got to have the owners to buy the horses and then you've got to train them."},
{"title": "How a young Qatari sheikh shook up the 'Sport of Kings'", "cate": "sport", "content": "The young Qatari royal was instantly smitten as he attended his first horse race at the home of British Flat racing in Newmarket.It was 2010, and Sheikh Fahad bin Abdullah Al Thani was so gripped watching the historic 2,000 Guineas Classic he bought his first race horse soon after.Together with his brothers, the now 29-year-old - the son of a former prime minister of Qatar - has become a dominant force in the Sport of Kings.Their  is now challenging the world's biggest racehorse operations, such as Dubai ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al-Maktoum's Godolphin , and Irish billionaire John Magnier's Coolmore outfit.Last year, the brothers had one of their best seasons, making \u00a33.1 million ($4 million) in prize money in Flat racing in Britain alone. That's second only to , whose runners earned \u00a34.5 million ($5.9M), according to the .The Qatari ruling family are hugely significant players in the thoroughbred market, most notably in Europe, Jimmy George, marketing director of Europe's leading bloodstock auctioneers, Newmarket-based Tattersalls, told CNN Sport.They're a very well-established part of the global thoroughbred racing and breeding industry now, and hugely important to all the sales at Tattersalls.As a member of the Qatari ruling family, Sheikh Fahad is a wealthy man in his own right. But his meteoric rise can't just be explained by him throwing vast sums of cash at the sport. He has climbed to the top through a combination of canny investing, talent spotting and hiring some of the best people in the business.In the beginning, Sheikh Fahad asked David Redvers, a Briton who had run his own racing operation in England for 15 years, to become his bloodstock and racing manager under the Pearl Bloodstock banner.Their cooperation got off to a flying start when Lightening Pearl landed a first Group 1 success in the Cheveley Park Stakes in 2011. Later that year Dunaden scooped $3.9 million for winning the prestigious Melbourne Cup in a photo finish -- a significant sporting and business achievement given Redvers had bought the French horse for just \u20ac120,000 ($135,896) the year before.By comparison, Sheikh Mohammed finally won the Melbourne Cup, the world's richest turf race, only last year with Cross Counter, after more than three decades of trying and millions of dollars in investment. Dunaden, who also won the Hong Kong Vase and Caulfield Cup, is now retired to stud, having earned Qatar Racing more than \u00a35 million ($6.5 million) on the track.That's not bad for a horse without a fancy pedigree who was once bought as a yearling at an auction in France for \u20ac1500 ($1700) by a Dutch couple who ran a dog grooming and breeding business.Sheikh Fahad's Melbourne triumph eventually led to the foundation of Qatar Racing in 2012.Everything boils down to Sheikh Fahad's passion for the game, and when he won the Melbourne Cup in 2011 with Dunaden, he brought in the rest of the Qataris, Redvers told  in 2015.Chaired by Sheikh Fahad, with its bloodstock and racing activities managed by Redvers, Qatar Racing has grown into a global operation, with horses in training in Britain, Ireland, France, Germany, Australia, New Zealand and the US, according to its website. In 2013, Qatar Racing won its first European Classic when Just The Judge triumphed at the Irish 1,000 Guineas. Since then, the group, whose jockeys race in colors of claret with gold braid, has posted wins at Group or Grade 1 level all over the world, including in Australia, Canada, the US, France and Britain.Qatar's emergence as a racing superpower, alongside its other sporting interests, such as its controversial hosting of the 2022 Fifa World Cup, can also be witnessed off the track.Qatar Racing is owned by QIPCO Holding, one of the biggest private investment companies in the gas-rich country. Sheikh Fahad's brother Sheikh Hamad bin  Abdullah Al Thani is the QIPCO chief executive. In 2011, QIPCO struck a multi-million-pound deal to back the British Champions Series, which includes Flat racing's biggest races. It opens a lot of doors for us, Sheikh Fahad told Bloomberg News in 2012. Sports unites the world, and that's the vision of Qatar. In 2015, QIPCO extended the agreement by nine years, taking prize money for the British Champions Day, the richest day in British racing in October, to \u00a35 million ($6.5) by 2024, and lifting prize money for the 1,000 and 2,000 Guineas races to \u00a3500,000 each ($657,000). It also continued its endorsement of Ascot Racecourse until 2024.Our sponsorship of the sport has benefited our bloodstock operation and increased the country's international profile, said Sheikh Hamad in a statement at the time. We are proud to support British racing and its wonderful heritage.Qatar Racing's top horse last year was Roaring Lion, a three-year-old colt saddled by British champion trainer John Gosden.Bought by Redvers for just $160,000 at the 2016 Keeneland sales in Kentucky, Roaring Lion was named Horse of the Year in Europe after winning four straight Group 1 races. Following his successful racing career, the grey was retired to Tweenhills Stud this year, where he is expected to out earn his \u00a32.7 million ($3.5M) prize money on the track.Roaring Lion has been the horse of a lifetime for us; he has exceeded our expectations, Sheikh Fahad, who watched Roaring Lion win the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes at Ascot in October while sitting next to the British monarch in the Royal Box , said on the Qatar Racing website.Never ones to rest on their laurels, Sheikh Fahad and Redvers are already on the lookout for the next big racing star.In October, Redvers spent 3.5 million guineas ($4.8 million) on behalf of Qatar Racing for a colt at Tattersalls sales, making it the most expensive yearling sold in Europe in 2018.Although it seems risky to pay so much money for an unproven racehorse, the colt is a full brother to Too Darn Hot, one of Europe's best-performing two-year-olds in 2018, also trained by Gosden. He could prove to be another sound investment for Qatar Racing.These horses don't come up very often, but if he's as good as the full brother he's a very cheap horse, Redvers told the Racing Post after the sale. We're all trying to make stallions and that's the future of our operation, finding these types that are good enough to be the most exciting horses at stud."},

For two fans, the tournaments are just a bike ride apart.  The kickoff between Japan and Russia in six months' time will bring to an end a journey that will take 231 days, spanning two continents and 27 countries. By that time, Ron Rutland and James Owens will be grateful to put their bikes to one side and watch some rugby. We're gluttons for punishment, Rutland tells CNN Sport from Bulgaria, just under four weeks into the journey.It's pretty relentless going to be honest. We're in our saddles probably about seven hours a day. South African Rutland is no stranger to long-distance adventures. Before the 2015 World Cup he embarked on a two-year, 42,000km cycle through Africa and Europe, arriving in England for the Springboks' first game against Japan -- which, famously, . Then last year he entered the Guinness Book of Records for completing where he caddied for scratch golfer Adam Rolston across the length of Mongolia.  To be honest at the end of that I was pretty broken physically, says Rutland. I had a hip replacement in the past year and I thought I was over it all -- I had had these two big adventures and maybe thought it was time to settle down and get a real job. I was doing just that. I was working in Hong Kong for the Hong Kong Rugby Union and thoroughly enjoying it, but there was so much excitement for the World Cup in Asia and I kind of got caught up in it.And so the Race to Rugby World Cup 2019 was born. Rutland and Owens, a Briton born and raised in Hong Kong, are undertaking the seven-and-a-half month journey to raise money for , a sports development program and the official charity of the World Cup.  Aside from sub-zero temperatures and frozen roads, the riders passed through Europe relatively unscathed. Temperatures will rise as they approach Japan via Turkey, Iran, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, China, Pakistan, India, Nepal, Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, and Hong Kong. There's  that tracks Rutland and Owens' progress, complete with a ghost rider they're competing against. He doesn't sleep so he has the advantage, quips Rutland. We wake up and he's already half a day ahead of us. That's the race element, trying to race him. World Rugby very kindly presented us with the match whistle for the opening game so we're carrying that. The World Cup won't wait for us.The pair are endeavoring to stick to their pre-planned route, but acknowledge that circumstances may force them to make diversions. Rutland is aware, for example, of the conflict in northern India close to where the current route takes them. Other than the English Channel and the sea between Shanghai and Osaka, we are determined to cycle every inch -- but not at the expense of doing anything reckless and stupid, he says. The south-Asian stretch will also throw up some of the most eye-catching parts of the journey. The Pamir Highway will take the riders through Tajikistan and into the Himalayas, a route that's long been on Rutland's bucket list. Then there's the Karakoram Highway, the iconic road that meanders from China down into Pakistan.The two riders have plenty to negotiate before they can even start contemplating rugby and the World Cup, but Rutland says that he has earmarked a few games he hopes to watch -- and is optimistic about the chances of his native South Africa. My heart tells me we can go all the way and I genuinely believe we could, he says. I think we're not one of the top two or three favorites but I quietly think we've got an outside chance. The optimist that I am will be cheering them on.Fingers crossed the Springboks deliver a happier ending than in 2015. "},

The attacks that took place last week, however, that saw a 28-year-old Australian gunman open fire at two mosques in Christchurch, have put the team's brand under the spotlight due to the Medieval religious wars between Christians and Muslims.The club continues to adopt imagery from the Crusades at games. Horsemen dressed in chainmail and carrying swords parade around the pitch, and captain Sam Whitelock plunged a ceremonial sword into the turf after last year's Super Rugby final victory. In terms of the Crusaders name, we understand the concerns that have been raised, CEO Colin Mansbridge said in a statement on the club's website on Sunday. For us, the Crusaders name is a reflection of the crusading spirit of this community. What we stand for is the opposite of what happened in Christchurch on Friday; our crusade is one for peace, unity, inclusiveness and community spirit.Emotions are very raw and real at the moment. There is the need for this community to wrap our support around those who are most affected by Friday's events, and that is the immediate focus for the Crusaders team. At an appropriate time, we will thoroughly consider the issues that have been raised and our response to that. That will include conversations with a range of people, including our Muslim community.This team and the wider organization are united with our community in standing against such abhorrent acts as that which occurred on Friday in Christchurch, and in standing in support of our Muslim brothers and sisters.The Crusaders' game against the Highlanders scheduled for Saturday was canceled.New Zealand rugby star Sonny Bill Williams, the first Muslim to play for the All Blacks,  to those who lost their lives in the attack and encouraged people to donate to those affected. Just sending my duas (supplication) to the families. Just sending my duas to your loved ones, said the Blues' center. Inshallah you guys are all in paradise ... I'm just deeply saddened, saddened that this would happen in New Zealand.Mourners in Christchurch paid tributes to victims of the attacks by performing renditions of the haka -- the Maori war dance performed by the All Blacks before each game but also used to pay respects at funerals.

The blaze ripped through the newly-built paddock after the first day of preseason testing in Jerez, Spain, with all the 18 bikes caught up in the damage. MotoE executive director Nicolas Goubert confirmed a prototype charging station caused the inferno that destroyed the majority of material.Fortunately there have been no injuries, a MotoGP statement read. The fire is thought to have broken out at 12.15am local time at the Circuito de Jerez. The all-electric series was planned to serve as a supplement to MotoGP and race on the same weekend, with 12 teams signing up for the  last year.The entire field had attended the test day ahead of the championship's scheduled start at the Spanish Grand Prix on May 5.MotoE confirmed the championship will still take place in 2019 but a revised calendar will be announced in due course. However, the competition will not race at the Circuito de Jerez.The bikes used for MotoE are adapted from the standard MotoGP bike design, much like what Formula E has done with its race car.We already started talking to Energica (company who build the bikes) to find out what the potential is to rebuild 18 bikes, because we lost 22 bikes in that fire, all parts and everything, former MotoGP rider Loris Capirossi, who has been helping MotoE with its electric bike development, told CNN.For our side we think we don't want to cancel anything but we have to find out if we can start the championship in Jerez (May 5)."},
{"title": "The 'new futuristic championship' aiming to connect with fans", "cate": "sport", "content": "With quirky features such as attack mode and fan boost, it's a racing series that has been likened to Mario Kart.But despite a small number of detractors labeling them little more than gimmicks, Formula E can boast to be one of the fastest growing sports in the world.In only its fourth year, the all-electric racing series -- brainchild of Spanish businessman Alejandro Agag -- recorded 300 million viewers across the course of the season.Part of the reason for its success has been the sport's ability to connect with fans, both with its proximity and online interactivity -- viewers can vote for which driver receives the additional energy through fan boost.It's the new futuristic championship, you know, HWA driver Stoffel Vandoorne tells CNN. Coming close to the fans [by] coming into the cities.We've got attack mode and fan boost as well, not the usual things you expect in racing, let's say, but this is what makes it popular, why it makes the racing entertaining.I think the attack mode has been something we've been experimenting with at the start of the season. So on some tracks it's been making a big difference and on some tracks it's been not making that much of a difference. We're still exploring how to position it on the circuit and what to achieve. It feels like Formula E is making maybe a little bit more of an effort to engage with the fans and get them involved in the sport.The four winners from Formula E's first four seasons have all had one thing in common: previous experience driving in Formula One.Less than three years ago, Vandoorne was thrust into an F1 cockpit for the first time to replace the injured Fernando Alonso in one of the McLaren seats.Driving a slow car in Bahrain, the Belgian driver put in a hugely impressive performance to beat his teammate, former world champion Jenson Button, in both qualifying and on race day, finishing 10th to secure a point on his debut.However, the following two seasons -- Vandoorne's first full-time in F1 -- at an ailing McLaren team proved unsuccessful and the 26-year-old found himself without a seat in 2019.Despite there evidently being several interchangeable skills between the two sports, Vandoorne believes they deserve to respected as two separate disciplines.I think at the moment, a lot of people want to try and compare from Formula One and Formula E, when actually they're completely different, Vandoorne says.Like Alejandro said, they don't really want to compete against each other, they're both their own championship with Formula One being kind of, you know, the pinnacle of motorsport -- the highest you can achieve.If you look at the start of this [Formula E] season, there's been four different winners. So there's always that unpredictable part. We don't see the dominance, let's say, that there is in Formula One.In F1, when you look at a race there is going to be a silver or red car that is probably going to win, adds Vandoorne, referring to Mercedes and Ferrari. In Formula E it's completely different -- everyone has a shot at winning the race.Despite his previous racing experience, Vandoorne's debut Formula E season with HWA Racelab, an arm of Mercedes, has been a tough introduction to just how brutal the sport can be.After initially showing promise by qualifying fifth in Saudi Arabia, he failed to finish his first two races before going on to record 16th-place and 18th-place finishes.However, Vandoorne is confident the team are close to producing a package that will allow him and teammate Gary Paffett to compete for points.Formula E celebrated a landmark 50th ePrix over the weekend in Hong Kong, a daunting, bumpy racetrack with tight, narrow corners and four different tarmac changes.It's a circuit on which truly anything can happen.Vandoorne qualified for the race in pole position -- his first in Formula E -- but was one of eight casualties that failed to finish in an action-packed ePrix.I think we're very close, very close, Vandoorne said ahead of the race. I mean, we've already showed in the last couple of races that we don't really have to do anything crazy to be able to achieve that.We just need to make sure that everything runs smoothly, we don't make mistakes and that's how it's going to get us towards [the points]. I think the pace is generally there on the car, maybe not the best, but it's there. It's good enough to be able to extract some points out of it. So I hope it's going to be around the corner very soon."},
{"title": "Could 'adopted Welshman' Warren Gatland coach the All Blacks? ", "cate": "sport", "content": "Any doubts as to whether Warren Gatland is amongst rugby's greatest ever coaches have effectively been put to bed over the past few weeks as Wales surged to a third Six Nations grand slam under the New Zealander's guidance. Recent victories have been hard-fought and unspectacular, built on gritty defense and tactical nous rather than individual brillaince. But as a collective, Wales has shone -- a record 14th consecutive  taking Gatland's side up to second in the world rankings. No coach has accrued more grand slam titles than Gatland, and sandwiched within his decade coaching Wales have been two successful stints with the British and Irish Lions that culminated in a drawn series against New Zealand in 2017. The upcoming Rugby World Cup will be Gatland's last act with Wales, after which his services are likely to be in high demand. And with Steve Hansen also announcing he'll be vacating his role as All Blacks' head coach, Gatland could be poised to get his hands on the most prestigious job in the sport.   I know he's a very proud Hamilton man, he'd want to go home I'd imagine, Wales' record try-scorer Shane Williams tells CNN Sport. And who knows? Every Kiwi's dream is to be an All Black ... perhaps coaching the All Blacks is the next step. He won't be short of offers, that's for sure.Williams played under Gatland during the latter stages of his 11-year international career, part of the side that won the 2008 Six Nations grand slam just two months after the New Zealander took charge. Few could have foreseen Gatland having such success with Wales, given his previous spell as an international coach ended seven years previously when he was sacked by Ireland. Without doubt he is the most successful coach we've ever had, says Williams. He's one of the best coaches I've worked with personally. He gets the players, he gets the best out of the players, he gives them confidence and that's something perhaps Wales as a nation in the rugby jersey haven't quite grasped over the years. But now they are a team that believe in themselves. It'll take a very good team and performance to beat them and a lot of that is down to Mr. Warren Gatland. At the moment he deserves all the credit he gets.The reasons behind his success, Williams explains, are down to his likeability as a person as much as his rugby brain.  He was a good man-manager, says the winger, who ended his 87-cap career with Wales in 2011. He was a good people person, very friendly and very approachable. He listened to the players and knew that he wasn't going to be right 100% of the time. He learned from the players around him as well. He's just a really nice guy. I know that sounds like a silly thing to say for a coach but I've worked with coaches as well and sometimes it's hard work to get a conversation with them. Warren, he's very sociable, he enjoys the interaction with the players and he learns every game, whether he wins or loses. He developed with the Welsh team and slowly has become an adopted Welshman. He's a very, very good coach.There will be heavy competition for Gatland's signature after the World Cup -- a period that will see a number of high-profile coaches leave their roles.  The job he'd obviously like to have is the New Zealand job, Dafydd James, who scored 16 tries in 48 appearances for Wales between 1995 and 2007, tells CNN Sport.Steve Hansen's going to be stepping down and there's going to be a few top nations trying to get his services and one would probably be England with Eddie Jones not really having the run that they thought he probably would get ... We'll see how that pans out.To solely credit Gatland for Wales' success over the past year, says James, would be overlooking the impact of the wider coaching team he's assembled around him. In Englishman Shaun Edwards, Wales has had access to arguably the best defensive coach in the world and this year's Six Nations campaign was proof of that, conceding just seven tries and boasting the best tackle completion rate in the competition. He's been very instrumental in the way Wales have performed, says James. He brings that hard edge and resilience to the defense and he binds the team. He commands that respect. He's going to be really missed [after the World Cup] but it will be another opportunity for another man coming in.The World Cup will give Gatland, Edwards and co. another chance to enhance Wales' reputation, contesting a pool alongside Australia, Fiji, Georgia, and Uruguay. There's no reason why Wales can't perform exceptionally well, says James. I think it's the greatest opportunity we've got to progress right to the latter stages. If we don't get to the quarterfinals, I'll be bitterly disappointed. We've got to be looking at semifinals at least really.Williams agrees that the current Wales team is a tough one to beat. It is probably the strongest depth of a team I've seen certainly in my lifetime and that's what's winning them the games at the moment, he says. They are so stubborn, they play with such pride and passion that they don't want to lose games. They're probably not playing their best which is a very frightening prospect."},
{"title": "Found as a dying baby, Haitian Celine Marti is now an international skier", "cate": "sport", "content": "Her heart racing and stomach tightening, Celine Marti stands in the start gate and focuses on her breathing. With seconds to go, she looks out at the vertiginous slope in front of her and thinks about her daughter, her parents, and the Haitian people she is representing. Against the odds, she has made it.The clock starts beeping. She flies out of the gate and down the mountain. She feels liberated. As the 39-year-old crosses the finishing line, she raises her arms and charms the crowd with her infectious smile. It is, she says, an explosion of the senses. Marti finished 52nd in her race, the slalom at last month's World Ski Championships, over a minute behind champion Two days earlier, she had come 82nd in the giant slalom. But her participation in Are, Sweden was never about winning. She doesn't ski to win. It is about love, determination, overcoming adversity. I have a saying: If you have a dream, you walk and you go, the Haitian tells CNN Sport. The start of the race is a difficult moment, but when you arrive at the end it is so exciting. I love the difficult things. That's my spirit.As a baby Marti, who will be 40 in April, was found on the streets of Haiti by missionary workers. She was adopted by a Swiss couple from Geneva who ignored warnings that the then nine-month-old was not expected to live for much longer. It's difficult to know exactly what I had, but I wasn't in good health, recalls Marti, who now has an adopted child of her own and works as a police officer in Geneva airport. With the love and support of her adoptive parents, Marti was encouraged to pursue any sport or hobby she wished. At a school camp she skied for the first time and immediately fell in love with it. She was hooked. During school holidays she would head for the slopes, taking the bus alone to Saint-Cergue, a small ski station close to Geneva, and eventually started teaching at her local ski school. In 2016, while competing at the Haitian ski championships in France, she met Thierry Montillet, a member of the Haitian ski federation, who persuaded her to represent Haiti at the World Ski Championships in St. Moritz in 2017. Her achievements have since been covered in the country of her birth where, Marti laughs, journalists have to explain what skiing is. She sees herself as representing both Haiti and Switzerland, and though she says she doesn't see color, Marti acknowledges she is one of few black Alpine skiers. I would like to prove that if you love the discipline, it doesn't matter for the color or origin. If you love it you go, she says. I had this chance of a new life and I profited to the maximum. I made my dream happen. Marti has only returned once to Haiti, the poorest country of the Americas, according to  to adopt her daughter, Joanne, nine years ago. Now aged 10, Joanne and her mum ski together and, sometimes, even compete together on the slopes in Switzerland. As she is not a professional, Marti cannot afford to race or train as often as she would wish. Time on the snow is restricted to the weekends as ski passes are not cheap. Though her equipment is sponsored by Rossignol, it has been difficult to attract sponsors. It's difficult for me to ask for that, she shyly admits.The Haiti federation is a small federation and we don't have much [of a] budget and I need sponsors to help me. Of course I would like to train more, but I go by car to the mountain at the weekend. It's difficult to go every weekend for training. With help I think I can achieve more. We try on a small budget to go to the maximum.Despite the financial constraints, the police officer's regime is, nevertheless, relentless. Her dream is to compete at the Winter Olympics in Beijing in 2022 and, on listening to her speaking about her training routine, it becomes clear little will stop her achieving her ambition. On a typical day, after taking her daughter to school, Marti will cycle to work and, following an eight-hour shift at the airport, will head to the gym. Often she will train alone, pushing herself to the limit. No-one can question her stamina because not only does Marti ski, but she also competes in triathlons, marathons and iron man events.As long as my body is OK, I will continue, she cheerfully says. A landmark birthday may be approaching, but there is no stopping her. The next [World Ski Championships] is in Cortina in Italy and would like to go, she adds.I would like to continue this dream and three years it's the Olympic Games and it'd be the dream to represent Haiti in the Winter Games. I think it's possible to see the Haitian flag in China."},

Another win.The unstoppable Mikaela Shiffrin has been scintillating all winter, and she put the gloss on a remarkable campaign with victory in her last race at the World Cup finals in Andorra to push her record 17 wins in a season.The American cemented her status as ski racing's preeminent athlete with victory in Sunday's giant slalom in Soldeu to edge to 60 World Cup wins and seal the giant slalom season crown.It was her fourth crystal globe of the season to go with a third straight overall title, sixth slalom crown in seven years and first super-G honor.I was able to compete with focus to the end of the season and that's been a really big goal of mine. It's amazing, she told the International Ski Federation (FIS).Shiffrin has blasted into the void left by Lindsey Vonn in her injury-hit final season and has made significant waves outside the sport of skiing.She ends the season fifth on the all-time list of World Cup winners, 22 victories behind Vonn and 26 short of the record held by Swedish great Ingemar Stenmark, who retired in 1989 after 16 seasons on the elite circuit. By comparison, Shiffrin made her World Cup debut in 2012.  She was virtually assured of the giant slalom crystal globe before the final race, taking a 97-point lead over Slovakia's Petra Vlhova into the final race. A barnstorming first run gave her the luxury of a cushion in the second, and though she lost time she finished 0.30 seconds clear of New Zealand's Alice Robinson with Vlhova in third to top the standings by 137 points.She slumped to the snow in the finish area and later appeared overcome by emotion as she clutched the crystal globe. Shiffrin, who passed Vreni Schneider's mark of 14 wins in a season earlier this month, becomes the first skier -- male or female -- to win the World Cup title in overall, slalom, giant slalom and super-G discipline in the same season.Shiffrin also won a fourth straight slalom world title last month and also took super-G gold in Sweden.Her slalom victory in Andorra Saturday gave her a 40th slalom win to equal Stenmark's slalom record.On the men's circuit, young French talent Clement Noel, 21, scored his third win of the season with victory in the final slalom in Andorra.Austrian great Marcel Hirscher had already wrapped up a sixth slalom crown in seven years to add to an eighth consecutive overall title and finished well down the field."},
{"title": "'Hardest decision': Ski ace Marcel Hirscher mulls retirement", "cate": "sport", "content": "He's accomplished way, way more than he ever dreamed possible and is arguably the greatest ski racer that ever lived, but Marcel Hirscher is contemplating retirement. The Austrian ace has won skiing's World Cup overall season title for an unprecedented  alongside countless other honors in a glittering career. But at just 30, Hirscher could hang up his race skis with the all-time record for World Cup wins tantalisingly within his grasp.Hirscher and wife Laura had their first child -- a boy -- last year, and priorities have changed. Ski racing is not the most important thing any more, Hirscher told CNN's Christina Macfarlane for Alpine Edge at the World Cup finals in Soldeu, Andorra. Nonetheless, Hirscher is finding it hard to turn his back on a life that has given him so much.This is maybe the hardest decision in my life because I'm not saying, 'OK, I'm going to jump into a new job,' I'm going to end a part of my life which has been today, my life.If you have done this for 10 years with this intensity, with tears, sweat, success and suffering, all the ups and downs. It's not easy to say 'Ok, I'm done with it.'Hirscher sits third on the list of most successful ski racers with 67 wins, just 15 short of Lindsey Vonn and 19 behind record-holder Ingemar Stenmark.At an average of eight wins a year for the past eight years, he could surpass Stenmark and cement his legacy as the GOAT in a handful of seasons. That's if American superstar Mikaela Shiffrin, who has already thundered to 60 World Cup wins, doesn't pass him in the meantime.  But that's at least two more years of pursuing the unrelenting goals of an elite athlete, trying to stay ahead of the chasing pack. The biggest challenge is to improve yourself year by year, said Hirscher. The others are not sleeping.The grind, travel and familiar rhythm of the ski circuit is another factor weighing heavily on Hirscher's mind.Knowing on December 25 I'll land in Denver, five steps, turn left and there is the parked car and go to Vail for four or five training runs, dinner at the same restaurant, he says, reflecting on his routine.I'm used to those rituals during the season and this can be sometimes as well frustrating and is not always motivating, knowing what I'm going to do. Talking in Soldeu, Hirscher admitted he was glad the season was over, but he said it wasn't the right time to make a definitive decision on his future.Today is the wrong day for this question, he said. At the moment I have no motivation. But it can change in one or two weeks.Right now I feel brilliant, my body, my mental side, we have so much experience, we are all getting better and better, the team is growing more together, we're not at the peak, it's really the toughest situation so far in my career.I don't want to stop ski racing by saying I'm not anymore in the top 15 and now I have to stop. I want to stop because I've made the decision that I have no fun anymore or I'm tired of ski racing.Growing up in the small town of Annaberg in eastern Austria, Hirscher didn't see himself as exactly on the fast track to greatness. When he joined the World Cup tour at 18, a single victory would have represented career success. Where I grew up nobody had done that before, he said. It would be something you can be proud of and maybe one medal at a world championship. Wow. I dreamed never too big. I hate to dream really big and at the end of your career have just reached one percent of big dreams. That's not fun. Better to have small dreams and live it big.Hirscher has lived it large, and to many he is already the best ever.Whether he retires or carries on in search of the all-time record, it will be on his terms -- and now those of his wife and son, too. It's more important he's doing good and everything with the family is good, then comes ski racing, he said."},
{"title": "How sailing can offer vital lessons in leadership and teamwork", "cate": "sport", "content": "Leadership lessons pop up in all aspects of life but skippering a sailing yacht offers a glimpse of the deep end.With weather, wind and waves to contend with, a crew to cajole and keep safe, navigation to be worked out, and an expensive boat to maintain, strong leadership is a must.Racing ups the ante and the stress levels. The skipper must also ensure the boat is being sailed fast, the crew are motivated, and strategic decisions are made quickly and decisively.You're effectively playing chess on water and you're managing risk all the time, said Britain's Ian Walker, who is a double Olympic silver medalist and Volvo Ocean Race-winning skipper.Sailing is an adventure, but it can be dangerous, with myriad hazards at play, from nature and the sea, to bone-crunching equipment and human error. Team work is a must, and that starts with the skipper.  , the first person to skipper an all-female crew in the then Whitbread Round The World Race, believes squeezing the best out of a crew is perhaps the most vital skill to have as a leader. After all, it's the crew that ultimately wins races. I think understanding what motivates each person within your team is an extraordinary piece of knowledge, Edwards told CNN Sport. It enables you to do so much. She learned a valuable early lesson from her skipper on a trans-Atlantic voyage from Antigua to Portugal. The young Edwards was tasked with learning the navigation system, a feat that seemed impossible at first. Despite initial doubts, she mastered the art and says her skipper's belief unlocked her potential. With good leaders there's that innate understanding of how to get the best out of people and how to inspire them, said Edwards, whose 1989 Maiden challenge is the subject of a recent film.   Edwards believes being able to adopt different leadership styles, depending on the situation, is something that sets the best skippers apart. At first, you've got this amazing team of people that you've picked and you want it to be a democracy because you want them to give you their knowledge, she added. However, such an approach simply doesn't work in critical conditions or in life or death situations, when the crew is looking for clear directions.   If you faff around you're endangering people's lives so that really taught me that even if you're wrong, sound very determined about it, she said, remembering a time during the Whitbread where her team were battling through huge seas and howling winds.But then of course when you get it wrong, you have to admit it afterwards. Adopting a confident front is vital for the skipper of an elite boat, says Walker, who won his first Olympic medal at the Atlanta Olympics in 1996. Going into the 2000 Games in Sydney, Walker was the senior member of his two-man Star boat and knew his partner Mark Covell was feeding off his apparent confidence.  It was very important that he believed I knew what I was doing, Walker told CNN Sport. Quite often, I didn't know what I was doing or at the very least I was questioning what we were doing.Despite growing concerns that they weren't fast enough and weren't going to deliver on the biggest stage, he continued to shoulder the burden and hide his insecurities. However, just weeks ahead of the competition, Walker began to crack and was faced with a decision that faces all leaders. Does he continue with the facade or tell his teammate the truth?I just had to open up and get rid of that burden because it was making us sail worse, admitted Walker, who went on to secure a second silver medal.  In the end, I couldn't carry it on because the integrity side came out.  For Dutch sailor Carolijn Brouwer, a three-time Olympian and the first female winner of the Volvo Ocean Race alongside Frenchwoman Marie Riou, there are two keys to good leadership. A good leader is someone who is humble, Brouwer, who is set to become the first woman at the helm of an America's Cup challenger, told CNN Sport in an interview from her home in Sydney, Australia. And the best leaders are also those that are able to show their vulnerability.Much like Walker opening up about his doubts, Brouwer remembers a time during the race where her skipperCharles Caudrelier demonstrated impressive levels of communication. He was doubting himself, he didn't think he was good enough for the team. As a result, he didn't eat or sleep properly, and got irritated, she told CNN Sport from her home in Sydney, Australia.But the beautiful thing was that he told us about it, he was very direct about it, which meant he gave us the chance to help him with that.And that's very important. You can't do everything completely in the right way all the time. And the fact that you are strong enough to show your vulnerability, giving people the chance to help you, and you solve the problem, is what makes you a strong leader.After working through his vulnerabilities, the team went on to win the Volvo Ocean Race -- not because they were the best sailors but because they were the best team, said Brouwer. According to Walker, leadership qualities can manifest themselves in different ways.You can have very authoritarian leaders who are very charismatic but then there are those quieter leaders who are every bit as much leaders, he said. They have a different way of getting the maximum out of their team.But no matter how good a team is, there will always be disagreement. Dealing with such conflict under extreme pressure is part and parcel of skippering a large yacht in the Volvo Ocean Race. In his second Volvo Ocean Race in 2011, Walker was faced with a critical decision when his boat suffered damage in the Southern Ocean. Half of his crew wanted to continue around Cape Horn off the southern tip of South America, while the other half wanted to retire to Chile.The decision rested with Walker, and he made the call to head to Chile, but he had to work hard to appease the members of his team that wanted to carry on. It was important that I listened to everybody and then I made a decision on what I thought was the best decision for everybody, said Walker, who is now director of racing for the British sailing team. It was about transparency, about being decisive and not wavering. I've always been able to make decisions, I'm not afraid of taking responsibility. Additional reporting by Danielle Rossingh"},

Inconsistent weather patterns arising from changes in the earth's atmosphere can lead to prolonged periods of bitter cold and snow.  Heavy snow can result as warmer air can hold more moisture which produces more snow if conditions are cold enough.  But on the whole, these bouts of cold and heavy snow will be fewer and farther between as the climate warms.Brignone is just one winter sports athlete who has noticed more erratic weather patterns since she began racing on the World Cup circuit in 2007.It's warmer in the summer, but the past few years, I've never been so cold, said Brignone. There were times last year in Pyeongchang and in Killington [this year] where it was -25 C. The climate is changing, because in one or two days it will go from -25 C to 5 C. That's crazy. The rapid deterioration of the glaciers that sustain early season training is forcing today's coaches and racers to reassess how they prepare for the annual circuit. I've been going to glaciers for 20 years to train, said veteran World Cup racer Resi Stiegler. You wouldn't have even thought it was warm out 10 years ago. Now you're [skiing] in T-shirts.Even the tallest peak in the Alps isn't immune to warming temperatures. The Mer de Glace glacier, which descends from Mont Blanc near Chamonix, France, is melting at . The biggest thing I've seen is the glaciers are melting at an incredible rate, American speed queen The glaciers I went to when I was a kid don't look anything remotely like they used to. You go up to Zermatt or Saas Fee or Hintertux or Soelden, they've got very little of the glacial ice they used to have. It's sad, not just for the sport but that's our planet. It really irritates me and frustrates me that people don't acknowledge global warming exists.It's not only skiing stars that are worried.At the historic Hahnenkamm race weekend in Kitzbuhel this season, long-time ski racing fan, movie star, politician and environmental activist Arnold Schwarzenegger called out President Trump for his stance on climate change, saying he was making a big mistake by pulling the US out of the  by 2020.In February, the head of the International Ski Federation, Gian-Franco Kasper, was forced to issue an apology after referring to  in an interview with Swiss newspaper Tages Anzeiger.The 75-year-old Swiss, asked to elaborate on the subject, said: There is no proof for it. We have snow, sometimes even a lot of it. I was in Pyeongchang for the Olympiad. We had -35 Celsius. Everybody who came up to me shivering I greeted with, 'Welcome to global warming'.He later said his comments had been misunderstood. The Alps experienced one of its snowiest winters in recent years in 2017-2018, while this season there was unprecedented snowfall in some regions and a dearth in others. For World Cup organizers, winter weather is an occupational hazard -- storms are needed for snow, but too much, or too little, and races have to be rescheduled or canceled. The men's season opener in Solden, Austria in October was canceled because of high winds and excessive snowfalls, while December's women's World Cup events at Val d'Is\u00e8re were rescheduled elsewhere because of a lack of snow and warm temperatures.In January, huge snowfalls across much of the northern Alps forced the cancellation not only of World Cup races in St. Anton, Austria, but the whole town being closed off for avalanche safety reasons. Exceptional circumstances call for exceptional measures, said a statement on the St. Anton website.There are locations, mainly in Austria and southern Bavaria, where we haven't seen this level of snowfall ever before, or at least not to that extreme, said Florian Pappenberger, the director of forecasts at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts.Races in Bansko, Bulgaria, Garmisch-Partenkirchen in Germany and 2014 Winter Olympics venue Rhosa Khutor in Russia were also called off because of heavy snow, despite the best efforts of organizers to stage the events.Sometimes we have to admit that nature is just stronger, said Atle Skaardal, race director for the women's World Cup circuit, in Rhosa Khutor.In an effort to combat nature's unpredictable rhythms, ski resorts have long used artificial snowmaking to create a decent base at the start of the season and to keep supplies topped up to the end. The increasingly sophisticated snowmaking systems are built primarily for tourism purposes but have become critical lifelines for FIS World Cup events. At Killington, Vermont, a late November host of women's World Cup races, a noticeable shift in seasons is recalibrating how the snowmaking team approaches its preparations.The seasons have actually moved, said Jeff Temple, director of mountain operations. It's harder to get those colder temps in November, and it seems like we've extended the season more.Killington examined decades' worth of temperature and snowfall data to model and map out what was needed to guarantee a decent piste and practice slope for the World Cup. The magic number: 130 hours of snowmaking, or five-days' worth of snow production. We call it a no regrets concept, he said. We have to take advantage of every hour we can get in October and November.If anything, the changing climate has helped level the field between those who rely on natural snow and those who don't, says Mike Solimano, president and general manager of Killington.For a long time, we've been less dependent on natural snow than everybody else, he said. We've had to invest a lot more in snowmaking in the last 25 years than everyone out West. Europe's mega-resorts are also heavily dependent on snowmaking in order sustain their ski tourism industry while also enabling them to continue to host the brand-enhancing World Cup circus. Courchevel in the French Alps unveiled 115 new snow cannons for the 2018-19 season -- making 700 in total across the whole of the interconnected Three Valleys region -- and has upgraded its snowmaking technology to higher-performing, more efficient systems that can blow snow in warmer temperatures. Normally, snow guns run at -4 C (24.8F), but now we have ones that can produce in -2 C weather, said Bruno Tuaire of the resort's Club des Sports, which organizes the regular Women's World Cup events in December. Courchevel also tried the radical technique of snow farming this year, conserving about 700,000m3 of snow under tarpaulins over the summer. Nearly 100,000m3 of it was left to start the 2018-19 season.However, one of the biggest ironies is that many of the ski racers actually prefer competing on artificial snow. Uniquely, for the World Cup trail, we need nearly all man-made snow, Tuaire said. There's never more than 50% of natural snow in the mix.For Brignone, racing on man-made snow translates into faster conditions.   The man-made snow is a little more sticky. It's so much more aggressive. You say, 'ok, the skis are going [downhill] so you go.'Despite the weather, Mikaela Shiffrin and Marcel Hirscher shattered World Cup records aplenty this season to showcase the sport in rude health.All eyes are on a bright future."},
{"title": "Sir Jackie Stewart: 'Finding a cure for dementia is my biggest ever battle'", "cate": "sport", "content": "Three-time Formula One champion Jackie Stewart has always liked to seek out answers to problems.When his wife Helen flipped her Smart car into woodland near the family home, he pored over the evidence for an explanation for the crash: a burst tire or a stray deer running across the road initially seemed the likeliest explanations.In the end the answer proved rather more complex and harrowing -- a diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia (FTD), which is an umbrella term for a group of degenerative disorders that damage the cells in the temporal and/or frontal lobes of the brain.The disease is typically diagnosed in people in their 50s and 60s, but can strike people in their 40s or younger.It affects areas of the brain responsible for reasoning, communication, social awareness and memory, causing changes in personality and judgment.Although its symptoms can vary depending on the parts of the brain affected, FTD eventually leaves a patient in a state of confusion and helplessness. It also leaves affected families feeling helpless.Five years on after his wife's diagnosis, Stewart knows this is a fight in all likelihood he and Helen will not win.This is my biggest battle, he told CNN Sport from the family home in Switzerland where he has relocated to ensure the best care for his wife -- there is a private hospital just 300 yards down the road and she has round-the-clock care at home.This is a truly global issue. There are 50 million people in the world and there's no cure and no preventative medicine. In the past 30 years, we've seemingly not got closer to finding answers.In the search for his own answers, Stewart took a different approach to the disease, setting up , which aimed to raise $2.5 million towards research in the disease. Already the initiative had raised over $3.5 million.He has traveled to the best medical facilities around the world and will use the money raised to date to fund five PhD students looking into finding a cure and potentially preventative measures.I would have helped anyway but Helen's illness has made me even more driven to help, he said. What's happening with the culture that currently exists hasn't worked so we need a change of approach. But the establishment doesn't like change.This year marks the 50th anniversary of the first of Stewart's three world titles and he draws parallels between his racing past and his current situation.Take Formula 1, he said. In modern times, there are four people really that have changed the sport: Gordon Murray, Ross Brawn, John Barnard and, most recently, .It's taken just four people to flip things on the head. In business, look at say Bill Gates or . All you need is a different mind, and a different approach. In the race against dementia, it's no different.Stewart plans to bring an F1-influenced approached to his PhD students. He will dress them in the finest clothes as though prepped for a business meeting and has also got F1 teams McLaren and Red Bull both involved in the charity. In addition, he wants to add an F1-style emergency to the approach.In trying to change the dynamics around dementia research, Stewart also references his own former fight for improved F1 safety having led the way for the safer sport enjoyed by drivers on the grid today.Back then, the establishment didn't want to recognize the problem or to change, he said. In those days, if there was a car fire there weren't the extinguishers to put it out. Okay, they had extinguishers but for a small barbecue not a Formula 1 car full of fuel and on fire.It was the same with the lack of run-off areas or telegraph poles or what have you. It didn't take Einstein to work out how to make things safer.This battle, though, is way bigger. I understand that the brain is the most complicated thing around -- far more complex than any Formula 1 car. And this is about understanding just a small part of it.For now, the key aspect is that his wife, in his own words, is happy, even though her short-term memory is on the wane, with her longer-term memory also slipping.Helen is in denial, reflects Stewart. She knows she has it but she'll tell you she doesn't.Stewart himself is under no illusions about what lies ahead for himself, the couple's two sons and their grandchildren as he recalls the experience of visiting the 93-year-old mother of a friend recently.Her face lit up like a rocket ship when she saw me. She wanted to talk about the past, about my shooting days [Stewart was a shooting international before his F1 days].You wouldn't know she had dementia then but then she said her husband must be working late tonight as he hasn't come back. He died 27 years ago.Just a few months shy of his 80th birthday, Stewart still oozes positivity from every pore and doesn't allow himself to dwell on the hardships in store.But he is all too aware the clock is ticking and a cure may be too late.That's a frustration, he said. Already, as the Beatles said, it's been a long and winding road but nothing's changed yet. But I have to believe that something will happen.Stewart calls himself one of the lucky ones with the finances earned from F1 enabling him to pay for the costly round-the-clock care.Others don't have that privilege, he said. It's those we need to help."},
{"title": "Mexico's 'green gold': The company powering cars with cactus juice", "cate": "sport", "content": "With climate change top of the agenda in most countries, more people with sharp ideas than ever before are needed to combat global warming.One Mexican company has taken that quite literally, harnessing the power of the prickly pear cactus to produce biofuel.Described as the green gold of Mexico, the nopal plant -- already a staple in Mexican diets, medicine and cosmetics -- is pureed and mixed with manure by a clean energy company called Nopalimex.The mixture is then left to decompose, a process which produces methane. Located in Michoac\u00e1n, central Mexico, Nopalimex uses the methane -- around eight tons daily -- to fuel a machine called a biodigestor, which powers their corn chip and cactus chip production. But they have also been testing the leftover mixture in local government vehicles in the nearby city of Zitacuaro.In 2015, the company became the world's first cactus-powered plant with the aim of finding a renewable alternative to fuel, while also creating social and economic benefits for Mexico.As long as the nopals are regularly replanted, the process is almost entirely sustainable, producing only water and nopal waste which can be used to fertilize crops.Nopalimex say the biogas will cost just 12 pesos (US $0.65) per liter, around a third cheaper than the cost of regular gasoline and estimates the fleet of buses and cars with the modified tanks will reduce their gasoline use by at least 40%.Cactus-fueled clean air? That's sure to prickle the fancy of Mexicans everywhere."},
{"title": "Formula E: The unpredictable racing series where the driver makes the difference", "cate": "sport", "content": "Five races, five different winners.The brilliantly unpredictable fifth Formula E season has the driver and team championships wide open with eight races still to go. It's good news for the sport's main protagonists as its new rules, tight street circuits and tough one-day racing mean the car is no longer the star -- it's all about the driver. Formula E is one of the last championships where the driver counts more than the car, Nissan e.dams racer Sebastian Buemi tells CNN. In Formula One it is all about the car -- if you put the best driver in the worst car he wouldn't be able to win. Whereas in Formula E it's not all down to the driver but they have a big impact on the performance, more than in any other championship., who made the switch from F1 to Formula E for Season Five, agrees: We don't see the dominance, let's say, that there is in F1.In Formula E it's completely different -- everyone has a shot at winning the race.Formula E's organizers are continually looking for ways to improve the spectacle and in Season Five the introduction of Attack Mode and a new race format are playing their part in this rollercoaster season.Attack Mode rewards drivers with an extra 25kw of power when they drive off the racing line and through the activation zone. With limited battery power, an extra boost of juice can make a real difference to the final places and points scored.I was a bit skeptical about Attack Mode but the way they've positioned it on the track (means) it is very difficult to go and activate it, explains Buemi. So that's created a lot of overtaking possibilities because the guy that goes to activate it loses so much time that (they) even lose a position. The gain of power is also interesting. It's been really good so far and it helps improve the show.A second Season Five innovation now sees each E-Prix last for 45 minutes plus one lap -- rather than a set number of laps used in other series such as F1. The pace of the race leader dictates when the extra lap comes into play so his rivals must make sure they have enough battery power to finish the race. The new ruling hit Pascal Wehrlein hard as he lost victory when he before the line in Mexico.You have to know what the leader is doing, explains Buemi. If the leader crosses the line at 44 minutes and 58 seconds you're going to have to do an extra lap which was not planned.In terms of strategy that has made it a lot more difficult compared to the first few seasons.Vandoorne agrees that plotting how to use and save energy in the heat of a race is a unique mental juggling act for the driver.In Formula E we have an amount of energy that we have to manage over the whole race distance, the HWA Racelab driver explains.You always need to constantly think ahead, think towards the end of the race when you're in the moment of heat, when all the action happens. It's not always an easy thing to do.It might come back at you towards the end of the race so you're always balancing things out.Adding the new rules into the mix has helped make the FIA's electric racing series pleasingly unpredictable as it pushes the drivers to their limits.The one-day race format means they have little time to learn the tracks and master the conditions -- something that proved particularly testing in Formula E's first wet race in Hong Kong.The series races on tight city center circuits that, unlike purpose-built racetracks, do not allow the comfort of run-off areas, instead car-crunching barriers punish mistakes.The cars also have less downforce than F1's winged racing machines making it easier for the rival drivers to race nose-to-tail and change positions.In Formula E you can make a lot of difference, adds Buemi, who won the Formula E title in 2016/2017.If you look at [the races in] Marrakesh or Saudi there are people who gained 20 positions in the race which is something you don't see in Formula 1 -- only the Mercedes can do that, no-one else.So the races are really unpredictable because of all this mix of things.The thrilling fight for the Season Five title continues on mainland China with the Sanya E-Prix on 23 March."},
{"title": "Who needs a ski lift when you can use a Zeppelin?", "cate": "sport", "content": "The giant Zeppelin hangs above the Alps like the spaceship of another planet descending on our own.But skiers Stefan Ager, Andreas Gumpenberger and Fabian Lentsch, come in peace; a trio seeking to achieve a world first.Their aim: to Zeppelin-ski.We saw a Zeppelin circling around the sky, recalled Ager of the light-hearted afterthought that led to the daredevils setting sail aboard their sky-ship from Friedrichshafen, Germany. As a joke, we just said: 'Let's do Zeppelin-skiing.'Two years later, as they abseiled down a 50-meter rope onto the 7,326-feet Kleiner Valkastiel summit atop the Austrian mountains, a pipedream inched closer to fruition; the ambition -- to ski down the peak's pristine Alpine slopes.According to Ager, from the trio's own research, these slopes had never been skied before, though the skiing was a piece of cake compared to being dropped on top of the Kleiner Valkastiel.It was the biggest challenge we'd ever faced, Ager told CNN. The skiing, which is normally the toughest aspect, was the easiest part this time. It was probably 20% of the challenge. The rest was getting the permits, getting the Zeppelin company to agree to do it, getting the legal rights.Even for a freeriding group whose previous expeditions have included hot-air balloon-skiing and a perilous trip to Pakistan to conquer a 6,000-meter peak, traveling in a airship provided a rare thrill.You cannot get rid of your smile because it is so surreal, Ager recalled. The feeling is somewhere between a hot-air balloon and helicopter. A helicopter can go anywhere, and it is already cool to fly.A balloon is cool because it is almost silent. But the Zeppelin is just so unreal, and it is a crazy feeling even just to sit inside of it -- it is such a small cabin. You look out of the window and you can see the rear propeller 60 meters away from you.During the first half of the 20th century, these floating aircraft -- some measuring longer than two football fields -- traversed the world's oceans. The largest airship -- the Hindenburg, had sleeping berths for 72 passengers, dining areas, a lounge, a bar and a promenade. (Compare that comfort to today's airlines.)When the Hindenburg was flying during the 1930s, people were so sure airships would dominate air travel that the top of New York's then-new Empire State Building was outfitted with a mooring mast where airships could attach.The airship is just stunning, said Ager. It is so majestic. You are impressed when it is just there in front of you. It is not normal. Most people don't even know that they still exist.Requiring two years planning the trio's adventure wasn't without snags -- a flight test in the fall of 2018 failed to conquer the peak's mammoth altitude due to warm temperatures.Our actual fear was of whether we would be able to make the height, Ager said. It [the Zeppelin] is meant to go up to 1,000 meters above sea-level, but we needed it to go higher in order to get it to the mountains. It is not built for that.Throughout the whole flight there on the way to the peak, we were not sure whether we would be able to make the height. As we approached the mountain, that really was the first point of relief because it was the first time we knew that we would be able to make the height.We had to spare every kilogram we could spare. It meant there was no director on the airship, no photographer. Just one cameraman and us skiers.Because it was reliant on the temperatures, it had to be very cold, no wind, clear weather, good skiing conditions and as little weight as possible. It was almost impossible to even find a day suitable to make the height.Finding a time at which the Zeppelin was not adorned in branding also proved tricky. Eventually, a period of three weeks was put aside for the adventurers.His colleague, Gumpenberger, added: This was more than just abseiling off a giant zeppelin. The cabin of the airship had to be adapted slightly and the pilots were at their limits in points of flight altitude and range of the airship.Facing danger, however, is at the core of any extreme athlete's make-up. It is not so much that the risks are not considered, just that they are factored in and minimized.We think that it is more dangerous to text and drive than to do Zeppelin-skiing, Ager laughed. We plan it to the greatest detail we can possibly plan it. Once you've done that, you don't think about the risks anymore because, in your head, there are no more risks left.The biggest risk is to ski down and even that is what we do for the whole year. For us, it is not dangerous. We do things like rappelling, skiing and paragliding all the time.We try to minimize the risks to five percent. That five percent is not calculable in any sport or activity. It is more dangerous to drive to work than to do Zeppelin-skiing.The major hazard at play here, though, was not so much the risk of the Zeppelin overextending itself -- the pilot would not allow this to happen, but the ultimate possibility that after more than 700 days, this dream would die an anticlimactic death.The danger was simply that we wouldn't be able to make the height, and we'd end up having to turn around and go home, Ager reflected.So what next for Ager, Gumpenberger and Lentsch?There is no other flying objects that we can do, he chuckled. I guess there is drone-skiing, where we hang onto an army of drones! We are not sure what's coming next. Without a doubt this is the craziest thing we have ever done.Indeed, when the freeriding trio finally touched down on an impeccable carpet of unspoiled snow, it was the culmination of an outrageous dream -- both of extreme sport and of planning."},
{"title": "Cash, Kings and Kohli: Shane Warne on the IPL's $2.5 billion juggernaut", "cate": "sport", "content": "He's one of cricket's most celebrated and pioneering stars, but buried among Shane Warne's myriad of honors with Australia lies a largely unheralded Indian Premier League title.It is an accolade pinned onto the end of his playing days, won at a time when such competitions were met in some quarters with disdain, cast off as exhibitions and little more than a final payday.Yet, leading the Rajasthan Royals to an IPL title in 2008 is, perhaps, among Warne's most underrated achievements. And as the event's 12th edition prepares for takeoff, there have been few more significant figures in the tournament's history.Inextricably linked to Test cricket -- the game's traditional pinnacle -- by virtue both of his rule over the format and the era in which he dominated the sport before the Twenty20 juggernaut had reached full flight, it is easy to forget Warne's importance to the IPL in its early days.He played a key role in easing initial skepticism over a competition that has since revolutionized cricket.His Rajasthan Royals team had been widely discounted as a threat. As Warne recalls, speaking to CNN: The only consistent thing in 2008 was that everyone wrote us off and said the Royals would come last.He was both captain and coach. Of the eight brand new franchises, the Royals were the least glamorous, without a star Indian name, and had cost the least ($67 million) when the outfits were initially to put up for auction. Yet, he led his Jaipur-based side to glory in the inaugural competition. In a league founded on gluttonous wealth, it was -- in relative terms -- a victory for the little guy. The story ignited a flame, a fire that burns brighter than ever 11 years later.I think [we] helped give the IPL credibility because the underdog came good, Warne says.To then go and win it in the style we did, that put the IPL on the map. Any underdog story like that -- you look at Leicester City, what they did. It's a pretty amazing story.I was very lucky to play in an era of Australian cricket where we were super-successful. We beat every team home and away, won World Cups, Ashes series, so we had some huge results.To be part of all of that with the Aussies and do those things was great but the IPL, it was completely different, he explains.For a sport so rigidly traditional, the sheer idea of a franchise-based tournament, with players allocated to newly-created teams through an auction, would take some getting used to.These days, however, the format is all the rage and similar entities now exist across the cricketing globe. You've got to remember that no one knew what to expect in that first [IPL] year, Warne reflects. 'What do you mean there's going to be owners putting up a paddle to buy players? What do you mean there's six different cultures all in different teams [playing] with young Indian players?'There's me, this has-been cricketer who had retired 18 months beforehand. [The other teams] all had their coaches with them and I'm the captain-coach. We lose the first game and go on to win it.They were soundly beaten by the Delhi Daredevils, before winning their next five games. Warne, the only non-Indian to captain a team in 2008, references Brendon McCullum's unbeaten century in the league's first ever fixture as another defining factor, an indicator of the levels that could be reached.Warne is speaking at the launch of the Rajasthan Royals Academy at Reed's School in Surrey. The first of its kind in the UK, it is an initiative that reinforces the exponential commercial growth of a six-week tournament.It's amazing how quickly [the IPL] has grown, reflects Warne. After only 10 years, I think when you consider all the other big franchise sports, this will be the fastest growing huge franchise.In 2017, Star India purchased the global broadcast rights to the tournament from . For a competition that lasts six weeks from beginning to end, it is a figure that highlights the league's enormous reach. It marked a five-fold upsurge on the initial agreement.Indeed, the league's first broadcast deal -- a 10-year arrangement with India's Sony Television network and the Singapore-based World Sports Group (WSG) -- was worth . The contract included a $908 million fee for the telecast rights, as well as a further $108 million for the tournament's promotion.Some of the pay packets for the players are huge, Warne adds. The Australian legend cost Rajasthan $450,000 when he was picked up at the tournament's first auction.At the 2014 auction, Indian all-rounder . In 2015, the same player was bought by the Delhi Daredevils for $2.7 million.The global reach and eyeballs that are watching these games is probably more than any other sport worldwide, Warne says of the ever-growing numbers attached to the competition. The global interest in the IPL and on their franchises is huge.Perhaps, there is no greater validation of the IPL's success since than Virat Kohli. Arguably the world's leading batsman across all of the sport's three formats, Warne sees a fundamental link between the India skipper's improvement and his IPL experience.Don't underestimate the IPL and the opportunities and what it has done for Indian cricket, he says.I remember Virat Kohli was very young when I first played in 2008. He couldn't really play the short ball.But being exposed to all the fast bowlers that were around at his franchise in Bangalore, suddenly [he was] practicing against it all the time, playing against it all the time, when at that stage they didn't experience that in India.There are 10 guys in the IPL now that can bowl at 150 kilometers per hour, so they're facing it all the time and they have got better.Such is Kohli's talent -- his personal statistics, especially in one-day cricket, are historically unparalleled -- he has remained a cheerleader for Test cricket even as the IPL has risen as an aspiration for any young Indian.I think we're very lucky in this era, Warne says. We've got Virat Kohli who's currently the biggest superstar in cricket saying: 'Test cricket is the most important form of the game.'So that flows onto the Ranji Trophy (India's first-class competition), and now suddenly that's more important, so all these players want to perform in the Ranji Trophy to get picked. That creates more interest in Test cricket, more people watching, more people attending. That has a follow-on effect to the world game. Young kids these days have so many more opportunities, a young boy or girl can go play T20 if they want to, but they still always have Test cricket if they want to.The most important thing is to play for your country. If you do that well and are lucky enough to have that opportunity, the rest of it will look after itself.At his very best, Warne's ability to spin the ball at speed made him unplayable.His talent truly arrived on the global scene in 1993; the image of his delivery to Mike Gatting, christened the 'ball of the century', has more than stood the test of time.He was named the Wisden Leading Cricketer in the World on three separate occasions, and one of Wisden's five cricketers of the 20th century. As a legacy, Warne's is unrivaled -- the sport's greatest ever leg-spinner.A man of 708 Test wickets, Warne is well aware of the challenges facing five-day cricket amid reports of dwindling interest levels. He, though, is remaining upbeat; encouraged by his position on the MCC's World Cricket Committee.We just had the numbers presented to us, he says. The one that stood out was that this is the highest interest rate of Test match cricket. So, the attendances might be down a little, but the interest and people watching and the eyeballs is much more than it's ever been. Now, is that because there's more access? 33% of the worldwide public watch everything on a tablet or iPad, so kids will be watching anything they want to watch on that. There's television, social media, there's so many different outlets.Indeed, last year's IPL final between Sunrisers Hyderabad and Chennai Super Kings drew a viewers on online platform Hotstar: a record for the live streaming of any event worldwide. When the competition gets underway on Saturday, its curtain-raiser will feature Kohli's Royal Challengers Bangalore and the Super Kings, last year's champions, captained by the peerless MS Dhoni -- a man whose fame and status have long-since transcended his sport. RCB, as Kohli's team is known, are viewed by many as the tournament's perennial underachievers. Runners-up on three occasions, the Bangalore franchise has never won the IPL despite a rich tapestry of superstars including the big-hitting axis of Kohli, AB de Villiers and Chris Gayle.The sheer scope of the IPL in a cricket-obsessed nation has allowed Warne to look back at his Rajasthan success with a rare satisfaction. More than simply winning in 2008, the Australian legend's greatest influence was in his methods.The victory would be the making of Ravi Jadeja, then an unheralded 19-year-old. A decade on, he is one of the world's best spinners, an integral part of India's national side. The form of Yusuf Pathan, who had only recently arrived on the scene, would propel him into the top tier of T20 sluggers. He would join the Kolkata Knight Riders for $2.1 million in 2011 IPL auction.If you think of the IPL, there is a lot of downtime, Warne explains. There is a lot of time in hotels, a lot of time traveling, in airports waiting in lounges, on buses.A notion he repeats is that of opportunity: the chance for youngsters to soak up as much knowledge as possible from their star colleagues and to change their lives.As Warne says: To sit around a dressing room for Yusuf Pathan, Jadeja and a few other young Indian players; to be mixing with players like Shane Watson, Graeme Smith -- who was captain of South Africa, myself as well as captain and coach; to interact and watch the way we train; to pick their brains -- 'How do you face this type of bowling? What you would do in a certain situation?'That was something that I did for the first four years as captain and coach. I just said: 'Okay guys, ask questions.'The Royals were the heart-warming tale that the IPL needed. Cynicism was replaced by a recognition of the league's possibilities.If you think of just India, there are 1.3 billion people and they all love cricket, let alone the rest of the population of the world, Warne explains.The opportunities are there. A lot of players who might be on the fringe and might not have had the opportunity to play against international players on a regular basis, suddenly have because people are looking for a great buy -- paying 'unders' for a decent player.For the opportunity for the younger player to grow now and be part of a franchise -- even if they don't play -- just to watch and experience it and get them hungry for it, is a huge thing.I think the IPL is probably the biggest learning curve for any player -- whether you're an experienced player or a young player. I think the young player obviously benefits the most.The competition has become a breeding ground for the sport's next generation. Afghanistan's Rashid Khan and Mujeeb Ur Rahman, as well as Nepal's Sandeep Lamichhane, are proof that neither age nor nationality act as barriers.Meanwhile, the development of Rishabh Pant -- voted the competition's emerging player of the year in 2018 -- into a major part of India's squad is a reminder of the IPL's impact on its own shores.As Warne sums up: The IPL has really helped the Indian team, but it has also helped other countries as well."},
{"title": "Winx secures 32nd consecutive win in George Ryder Stakes ", "cate": "sport", "content": "Out of this world is how part-owner Peter Tighe described Winx after her victory in the George Ryder Stakes at Rosehill, and the wonder mare's record is proof she is just that -- a once-in-a-lifetime race horse with a record that is unparalleled. Winx's victory on Saturday was her 32nd on the spin and her fourth George Ryder Stakes victory, three weeks before what could be the final race of her career in the Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Randwick. Hugh Bowman and Winx found themselves at the back of the field heading into the final 300 meters, before Bowman made his move round the outside of the pack to finish three-and-a-half lengths clear of Brutal and Dreamforce.  The victory means Winx is the first horse to win four Cox Plates, four Chipping Norton Stakes and four George Ryder Stakes in Australian racing history. Her winning run in Group One races is now extended to 24. She had them covered pretty early down the straight ... about half-way down the straight we were pretty confident that she was going to go on with it, said Tighe, who owns the horse alongside Debbie Kepitis, Richard Treweeke, and his wife Patty.She did what she does best and put them all to the sword. There's not a lot more you can say -- she's just out of this world.We don't want to go too crazy because we are going to have to come back to reality one day, but we're just loving every moment of it like everyone else. As long as she pulls up okay and everything is right tonight, we'll be back in three weeks to hopefully finish her career on a winning note.Racing on her home track in wet conditions, it was Winx's 36th win in 42 races, her last defeat coming in April 2015. Her trainer Chris Waller had eyed a second victory at Rosehill through Yes Yes Yes in the $3.5 million ($2.5USD) Golden Slipper, but that went the way of Damian Lane-ridden outsider Kiamichi. "},
{"title": "Jean-Eric Vergne ends pointless run with victory at Sanya ePrix", "cate": "sport", "content": "The unpredictable start to the Formula E season continued in Sanya as the sixth race brought a sixth different winner.Defending champion Jean-Eric Vergne not only picked up his first victory of the season, but also ended his three-race run of failing to score any points.The all-electric race championship was visiting the south China city for the first time and there was no shortage of drama with Sam Bird and Stoffel Vandoorne being forced to retire from proceedings in the opening stages.Rookie Oliver Rowland had qualified in pole position and, like Vergne, the Nissan e.dams driver was searching to change a luckless run of form having last scored points at the season-opener in Saudi Arabia. The two men battled it out at the front throughout the race, with the experienced Vergne finally breaking Rowland's resistance on lap 19 of 36.Following a crash between Lucas di Grassi and Robin Frijns, the race ended under yellow flag conditions, allowing Vergne to cruise to his first victory since the final race in New York last year.Winning here in China as part of a Chinese team is unbelievable, especially with the last three races being difficult when we had no points,  the DS Techeetah driver. It's always good to come back on top. It will boost the confidence of myself, the team, and put us back as well in a good spot for the championship. I think that was the turning point of the season, we need to keep on doing good work and good races in the European season.It was a stop-and-start affair in Sanya as a red flag was brought out and a 12-minute break enforced after BMW i's Alex Sims was left stranded in the track after colliding with the wall. That was before Frijns careered into di Grassi's rear while passing Sebastian Buemi in the race's closing stages, a move that left the Brazilian seething as he was forced out of the race.You crashed together and you took me out of the race -- I hope you get a penalty,  an incensed di Grassi. Next time, I'll get away from Robin. There was nothing I could do to avoid that.The result saw Vergne almost double his points haul in the standings, shooting up to third behind Jerome d'Ambrosio and Antonio Felix da Costa, whose third place finish in Sanya took him to the top of the championship. Victory in China was also Techeetah's first of the season 2018-19 when the new Gen2 race car has come into play, and Vergne admitted after his victory that  since going a third straight race weekend without scoring any points in Hong Kong. However, he'll now be able to rest easy with the assurance that he's back in the championship hunt as he bids to become the first man ever to successfully defend a Formula E title. The next race will take place in Rome on April 13. "},
{"title": "Electric car driver travels 90,000km in three years as strangers pay his way", "cate": "sport", "content": "For three years and 90,000 kilometers and counting, he's traveled the world powered both by electricity and strangers' kindness.Keen to spread a zero-carbon future message, Dutchman  effectively left home with empty pockets, the \u20ac20,000 ($22,618) he has spent since setting off in March 2016 going entirely on car repairs and shipping logistics, and earned from working on his travels.The rest enabling his electric Volkswagen -- nicknamed The Blue Bandit -- has come from the generosity of strangers from Norway to Iran and Myanamar to the United Arab Emirates on his journey to a finish point in Sydney next month.Wakker says it is impossible to estimate how much the trip might have cost if paying his own way, with total strangers having slashed that bill with both free accommodation as well as free meals as he drove towards Australia.His only error, he says, has been in underestimating mankind.That was my biggest failure because I've had so many people offer me help with this trip. I've traveled through areas said to be unsafe like the Middle East and India, but everywhere there was the kindness of local people.His  essentially involved people plotting his course on his website and offering three ways of helping: a meal, a place to stay and somewhere to charge his vehicle.Initially, he had planned to cover the route of a journey -- first plotted as an adventurous backpacker in Australia 10 years previously -- in 18 months only for it to become a more opportunistic route.He let his backers determine that route, which meant -- among other things -- taking him across the very circuitous route of going via the tip of northern Norway to get across Europe.When I started, I had no idea of the route, he said, but I know I never thought I'd go for this long. But so many people offered me places to stay, organized something and so I thought 'I can't brush this off and go as quickly as possible.' So, I've grasped it as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to enjoy to the maximum.As he eats up the final kilometers of the road, there is only partial celebration in approaching his finish point. There's a bit of sadness as well actually as it's nearly finished and I'm still enjoying it. I thought when it ended I'd be exhausted or super hungry but it really has been an experience of a lifetime.That is countered by the fact he is no longer driving an electric car without air conditioning -- the fuses on it went about a month ago -- as temperatures hit a high of 49 degrees Celsius in a particularly hot Australian summer. I've had to have coffee beans in the car to help cancel out the smell, he says laughing.Throughout the journey, he has driven where possible but sent the car by ship three times, and raised the money required by doing differing jobs along the way.Unsurprisingly, there have been mishaps with the car at certain points. First in India, a broken spring was welded in place but it caused the rear tires to wear down so the car was no longer drivable, and then it short circuited and the charger exploded.In Indonesia, the car got flooded and he could only repair it by flying out mechanics from his native Holland, but amazingly that \u20ac5,000 ($5,654) cost he raised by crowdfunding in the space of just 10 days.A born traveler, Wakker returned from his earlier Australian adventure a decade ago and studied events management at university, capped off by a thesis in entrepreneurship.From that was born the electric car idea, which took 18 months to get off the ground and was made possible with the help of a Dutch company called Bundles, which loaned him the car for the length of the trip.With it I wanted to prove the reliability of electric cars and what it's possible to cover, he said. It's still going pretty good.By his own admission, Wakker has not always been that green-minded but had that view shifted working for an events company, which got into environmentally clean projects including a dance floor at a music festival in which people produced the electricity for the festival by dancing.It showed that sustainability doesn't have to be boring but it can do cool stuff, he said.As for the future, he wants to remain active in the field of sustainability but is aware he's likely to need a period of adjustment when he gets back home.I'm excited to go back after three years of traveling, and really looking forward to having a base, put clothes in a closet not a suitcase, he said. It's a more stable life after this craziness. But what I'm doing has become a lifestyle so it could become a shock."},

The two teams walked onto the pitch side-by-side and a minute's silence was held before the match.Crusaders players wore white armbands bearing the word united and the date of the attack and the two opposing coaches Scott Robertson and Daryl Gibson -- both former players for the Canterbury club -- also stood together. It was pretty special, said Robertson. It was great to be beside Gibbo who was a proud Crusader in his day and a local boy. We never got to do it last week and saw a lot of other teams do it.The Crusaders' match against the Highlanders scheduled for last weekend was canceled out of respect for the victims of the attacks.That transcends sport, said Gibson, who spent six years as a player with the Crusaders. You think of others in far worse situations. It was a really nice touch tonight.That the Crusaders lost their first game since March last year -- a 19-match winning streak during which they were crowned Super Rugby champions for the ninth time -- was perhaps evidence that last week's events had affected the players. The 20-12 victory was the Waratahs' first win against the Crusaders since 2015 in a game that saw Australian international Israel Folau score his 59th Super Rugby try to equal Doug Howlett's record. Cameron Clark and Jed Holloway also crossed for the home side, while Bernard Foley contributed five points with the boot. The Crusaders replied through a George Bridge try before halftime, but Will Jordan's score with time up on the clock proved too little too late for the visitors. We were really desperate to play well and represent our people and show how much we care, said Robinson.You can see how hard we worked but we dropped enough ball for the whole season out there. It was a tough week, but we're Crusaders, we don't make excuses. We just needed to be better in a lot of parts of the game tonight.Discussions have been taking place as to whether the Crusaders  in the wake of the shootings given the association with conflicts between Muslims and Christians in the Medieval period. The club has adopted imagery from the Crusades ever since it took on the name in 1996, with horsemen dressed in chainmail and carrying swords a feature during home games. Thank you to everyone who has taken the time to express their views on our name and brand, the club said in a statement on Wednesday. We have received too many messages to be able to personally respond to them all, but please know that every comment will be read and considered.We are committed to undertaking a thorough process on this, but it should not be this community's primary focus right now.

The American, who has more than 800,00 Instagram followers, says she is realizing you can't make everybody happy.Something I really value is freedom of speech, freedom of expression and freedom of opinion, she said. And their troll-like hater comments is a bummer, it hurts, it kind of gets you in the heart but at the same time it's like, 'OK, they're allowed to think that and I have to be OK with that.' It doesn't mean it doesn't hurt, but say what you want and I'll just keep moving forward.Shiffrin dominated ski racing this season, winning a record 17 World Cup races and clinching a third straight overall crown to go with a fourth consecutive slalom world title and numerous other honors.Her achievements moved her to fifth on the all-time list of most successful ski racers with 60 career wins, behind only Annemarie Moser-Proll, Marcel Hirscher, Vonn and Ingemar Stenmark, who holds the record with 86.   And Shiffrin is sensing a blurring of the boundaries between genders, certainly in ski racing.    It's not about whether you're a female in sports who's powerful or a male in sports who's powerful, you're a person in sports who's powerful, she said. That's kind of a shift I'm starting to feel but I guess it takes a little while. There's always going to be that description of gender but right now, especially in ski racing, what I'm able to achieve in the sport is very even with what a man is able to achieve in sport and that's a really special feeling. The opportunity is there. Shiffrin has grown up in the spotlight since making her debut on the circuit as a 16-year-old in 2012, and she says the sport has helped her bloom as a person.I've definitely grown, I've come out of my shell in many ways, she added. I've definitely become  more confident in myself.She pointed to her growing collection of clips from her life on social media, including a recent one of her dancing.In high school I wouldn't be caught dead dancing in front of anybody, she said. But I always loved to dance and I wanted to be a good dancer and now I don't really care if I'm a good dancer, I just like to dance. I've become much more comfortable kind of being silly,  not feeling like I have to be perfect. Just being myself and sharing that with the world and it's pretty cool. "},

Fast forward to earlier this month and coach Joachim L\u00f6w, who has faced calls for his 13-year tenure to end, made the controversial decision to announce stalwarts Mats Hummels, Thomas Muller and Jerome Boateng would no longer be called up to play for the national team.With none of the trio over the age of 30, many felt their experience and quality could still be beneficial to an ailing squad.But their absence has left space in the squad for a new generation of players, three of which scored in Germany's thrilling Euro 2020 qualifier against the Netherlands Sunday.Leroy Sane, who was left out of Germany's 2018 World Cup squad -- a decision Low was widely criticized for -- gave his side the lead before Serge Gnabry made it 2-0 before half time.Some of the defensive and mental frailties which have hampered Germany in recent times reappeared in the second half, as Matthijs de Ligt and Memphis Depay drew Holland level in Amsterdam.But Hoffenheim star Nico Schulz made it a hat-trick of goals for players not called up in Brazil, rounding off a fine German move to snatch a stoppage time winner.To win away in Holland in the first game is very helpful for the belief of a newly-formed team, Low told reporters after the match. Also, the highs and lows that they went through today help their experience. A victory like today's helps for the coming weeks and months. However, I know that we have to keep working hard. We knew at halftime that the Netherlands would switch things up and start pressing higher, as they had nothing to lose. We started to get flustered and gave the ball away too easily. It's a process that a young team has to go through. What pleases me is that the team never lost the belief that they could win the game, and in the end we got our reward.Victory not only gets L\u00f6w's Euro 2020 qualifying campaign off to a perfect start, but also serves as revenge of sorts after a defeat and a draw against Holland in the Nations League helped relegate Germany from League A without a win.It was the first time in 23 years that Germany has beaten the Netherlands on Dutch soil, leaving both teams on three points and Northern Ireland at the top of Group C with six points after wins against Belarus and Estonia."},

It doesn't often happen to me, to score, and today it was really incredible. It is the most important goal of my whole career, Pedersen told the club's website.I'm happy all these people came to see us. We started well in the first half even though we were a bit nervous and we perhaps did not play our best game, but it was great to do it in front of this crowd.Earlier this month,  at the Wanda Metropolitano in the Spanish capital, setting the record for the best-attended women's club game in history.

I am truly sorry, Kraft said in a statement Saturday. I know I have hurt and disappointed my family, my close friends, my co-workers, our fans and many others who rightfully hold me to a higher standard.Kraft, 77, was charged with two misdemeanor counts of soliciting prostitution last month. He was among the more than 100 people who were linked to several central Florida day spas and massage parlors suspected of being used for prostitution and targeted by law enforcement during a Throughout my life, I have always tried to do the right thing, he said. The last thing I would ever want to do is disrespect another human being. I have extraordinary respect for women; my morals and my soul were shaped by the most wonderful woman, the love of my life, who I was blessed to have as my partner for 50 years, Kraft, a widower, added in reference to his wife Myra, who died in 2011 at the age of 68 after a battle with cancer.Kraft is currently dating actress, designer and model Ricki Noel Lander.As I move forward, I hope to continue to use the platform with which I have been blessed to help others and to try to make a difference. I expect to be judged not by my words, but by my actions. And through those actions, I hope to regain your confidence and respect.He also noted that he had decided to make a public statement on Saturday to express what he wanted to say for four weeks.Kraft pleaded not guilty to the charges and has denied that he committed a crime.He is arguably the case's most high-profile defendant, generating speculation over the possible consequences the billionaire could face should the allegations prove true.Authorities say Kraft was recorded on surveillance footage paying for and receiving sex acts at a day spa in Jupiter, Florida. The footage has not been released, and Kraft and other defendants want to keep it that way.Earlier this week,  seeking to prevent the videos and other evidence from being released. The request for a protective order said the evidence is part of an ongoing investigation and should not be disclosed.Kraft's lawyer, Jack Goldberger, did not return CNN's request for comment.A group of unnamed defendants pursued similar action arguing it was illegally obtained in violation of their right to privacy.Because the footage was obtained through a warrant, it's likely to be upheld as legal, said CNN legal analyst Mark O'Mara, an attorney based in Florida.What's in the defendants' best interest, he said, is ensuring the footage doesn't become public record. They can do that by keeping it out of the court file, he said, and the way to keep the footage out of the court file is to not request it from prosecutors as part of the pretrial exchange of evidence known as discovery.In the motion filed Wednesday, lawyers for Kraft and the other plaintiffs echoed this notion, saying the evidence was confidential and exempt from disclosure because none of it had been produced in discovery.As long as Kraft's lawyers don't have the footage, they can't give it to the NFL if the league asks for it, O'Mara said.Kraft's apology comes ahead of what would likely be a busy few days for the billionaire owner. On Sunday, Kraft and his fellow team owners are expected to attend the NFL's annual meeting in Phoenix. During the event, which runs through Wednesday, Kraft will meet with executives, general managers and head coaches to discuss changes in the league's rule book.He is also set to be arraigned on Thursday. Prosecutors have offered to drop misdemeanor charges against Kraft and 24 other men in exchange for fines, community service and an admission they would be found guilty should the case go to trial, according to Mike Edmonson, spokesman for the Palm Beach State Attorney's Office.But a source familiar with the case told CNN this week that he CNN's Emanuella Grinberg contributed to this report."},

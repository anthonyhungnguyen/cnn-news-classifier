Tell me where to go, I'll clear my schedule. I mean, Mike Schur currently produces and writes on, I think, 14 shows, so it'll really be whenever he is 'tech avail,' as we like to say in the biz. But yeah, I'm ready.Offerman also said he's game.Oh, sure. I'll do anything Parks and Rec as long as the brass is behind it, he told The Hollywood Reporter. I mean, the gifts that that show has brought to me I'm still collecting every day, and I don't imagine I'll ever feel that I've fully repaid them.Plaza said she's open to the idea.It's hard to recreate magic, [so] not yet. But I want to be around [the cast] all the time, she said. They're the best. I never have had more fun in my life. They're my family.

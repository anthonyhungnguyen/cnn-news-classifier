'The Case Against Adnan Syed' extends 'Serial' mystery
entertainment
The hunt for another true-crime sensation has been pretty unrelenting since Making a Murderer, but HBO cheats a bit with The Case Against Adnan Syed, essentially a sequel to Serial, the hugely popular 2014 audio documentary.As a consequence, this new four-part project ends up rehashing much of the case, while picking up where Serial left off in a way that weaves the media attention the original generated into the story, in much the way that the second season of .It is, for the most part, an engrossing account, although the filmmakers employ one extremely questionable device to help illustrate what had only been heard, not seen, using animation as a visual aid during voiceover excerpts read from murder victim Hae Min Lee's diary.Serial producer Sarah Koenig is shown accepting a prestigious Peabody Award for the podcast, marveling that she would be honored for devoting so much time to an old murder that I did not solve.As dense as Serial was, there's ample material for filmmaker Amy Berg to sift through, tied to the 1999 disappearance and murder of the 18-year-old Lee, and the eventual arrest and conviction of her former boyfriend, Adnan Syed.For starters, their hidden relationship speaks to cultural strictures -- she was Korean-American, he the son of Pakistani immigrants -- that created impediments to their relationship, issues that Lee addresses at some length in the diary entries.Mostly, though, The Case Against Adnan Syed operates as a mystery, raising the question of what happened to Lee, potential missteps by the Baltimore police and who -- if not Syed -- might have killed her, in the midst of an appeals process that won him the right to a new trial before bogging down in the courts. (Last week, Maryland's Court of Appeals allowing Syed a new trial, reversing an earlier decision in March 2018.)Like Making a Murderer, there's a good deal of time devoted to forensic minutia, like analyzing the grass at the location where Lee's car was found. The search also includes returning to interview high-school friends, and hunting down another of Lee's former boyfriends, while retaining a private investigator to help reexamine the evidence. One of the high-school contemporaries, Krista Meyers, expresses concern that Hae gets lost in the focus on Adnan and whether he was wrongly convicted, an inevitable byproduct when filtering such fact-based stories through the demanding prism of an entertainment culture weaned on Law & Order and CSI.Once again, The Case Against Adnan Syed raises troubling questions about the justice system, including the questionable behavior of police amid pressure to close high-profile cases. (It's also worth noting that Syed family friend and advocate Rabia Chaudry is credited among the producers.)The docu-series is not, perhaps, as compelling -- or certainly as unique -- as the podcast was. Three of the four installments were made available, so it's also to be determined how well the producers do in bringing this installment of the story to a conclusion, given the status of the case.Even so, for those who tuned into Serial, the new documentary makes a convincing argument for its own existence, in what has become, for better or worse, one of TV's most crowded genres.

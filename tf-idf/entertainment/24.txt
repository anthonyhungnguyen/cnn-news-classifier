Justin Pierson, a senior who worked on the sound crew for the play, that students got creative with the set design.This is going to sound really funny but (the set crew used) garbage essentially, Pierson said. Just anything that was lying around like cardboard and metal.The play ran Friday and Saturday night and went viral after social media users started posting photos and video.The students even put together a trailer that lives on YouTube.The ambitious high school production caught the eye of some in Hollywood, including The League star Paul Scheer, who tweeted about it.Can't stop posting video from this, he wrote.

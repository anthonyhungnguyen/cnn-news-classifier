According to the Patheos article, Tyson, who is the director of the Hayden Planetarium at the American Museum of Natural History, had been accused by one woman who alleged that Tyson drugged and raped her in 1984 -- which he denied.Tyson said they had briefly dated in graduate school but the chemistry wasn't there.Two other women accused him of making inappropriate advances and sexual harassment, dating as far back as 1984. In a lengthy Facebook post in December, he either denied or gave a different version of the women's accounts and asked for an independent investigation to be conducted. Accusations can damage a reputation and a marriage, he wrote at the time. Sometimes irreversibly. I see myself as loving husband and as a public servant -- a scientist and educator who serves at the will of the public. I am grateful for the support I've received from those who continue to respect and value me and my work.

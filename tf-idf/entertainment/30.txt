entertainment
The eyes of the entertainment industry are all on Apple. With a and producers in its fold that reads like the guest list to the best Hollywood dinner party of all time, the questions going into its big presentation in Cupertino, California on Monday are what will the company unveil, who will be there to do it and will Apple use the event as an opportunity to make clear what its mission is as it enters the original content space? Hopefully answers will come to at least some of that. At the very least, maybe Oprah, Steven Spielberg, Reese Witherspoon, or any other of the big names who've already joined the Apple family will show up and provide some clarity. The event starts at 10 a.m. PT/1 p.m. ET and can be streamed on .

Billed as three days of peace and music, it was inspired by the civil rights, women's rights and anti-war movements and became a defining cultural and historical moment attended by  hundreds of thousands.We've lined up artists who won't just entertain but will remind the world that music has the power to bring people together, to heal, to move us to action and to tell the stories of a generation, said Michael Lang, co-founder and producer of the 1969 and 2019 Woodstock festivals. Our hope is that today, just as in 1969, music will be the constant that can inspire positive change, he said.See the full lineup  Tickets for Woodstock 50 go on sale on Earth Day, April 22.

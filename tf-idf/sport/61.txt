Winx secures 32nd consecutive win in George Ryder Stakes 
sport
Out of this world is how part-owner Peter Tighe described Winx after her victory in the George Ryder Stakes at Rosehill, and the wonder mare's record is proof she is just that -- a once-in-a-lifetime race horse with a record that is unparalleled. Winx's victory on Saturday was her 32nd on the spin and her fourth George Ryder Stakes victory, three weeks before what could be the final race of her career in the Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Randwick. Hugh Bowman and Winx found themselves at the back of the field heading into the final 300 meters, before Bowman made his move round the outside of the pack to finish three-and-a-half lengths clear of Brutal and Dreamforce.  The victory means Winx is the first horse to win four Cox Plates, four Chipping Norton Stakes and four George Ryder Stakes in Australian racing history. Her winning run in Group One races is now extended to 24. She had them covered pretty early down the straight ... about half-way down the straight we were pretty confident that she was going to go on with it, said Tighe, who owns the horse alongside Debbie Kepitis, Richard Treweeke, and his wife Patty.She did what she does best and put them all to the sword. There's not a lot more you can say -- she's just out of this world.We don't want to go too crazy because we are going to have to come back to reality one day, but we're just loving every moment of it like everyone else. As long as she pulls up okay and everything is right tonight, we'll be back in three weeks to hopefully finish her career on a winning note.Racing on her home track in wet conditions, it was Winx's 36th win in 42 races, her last defeat coming in April 2015. Her trainer Chris Waller had eyed a second victory at Rosehill through Yes Yes Yes in the $3.5 million ($2.5USD) Golden Slipper, but that went the way of Damian Lane-ridden outsider Kiamichi.

PSG star Neymar is facing a ban after being charged by UEFAin the wake of his side's Champions League defeat to Manchester United.Neymar was a helpless bystander, watching the last-16 tie from the stands due to injury, as referee Damir Skomina awarded Manchester United a controversial last-minute penalty after a lengthy consultation with VAR.United striker Marcus Rashford converted the spot-kick to send the English side through to the quarterfinals as PSG suffered yet more Champions League heartbreak.This is a disgrace, they put four people who know nothing about football in charge of looking at the replay for VAR, the Brazilian wrote on Instagram after the match. It's just not possible!!! How is a guy going to hold his hand behind his back. Go f**k yourselves.The 27-year-old was furious after Skomina ruled that Presnel Kimpembe handled the ball in the penalty area and reportedly had to be restrained from entering the referee's office after the match.Neymar, the world's most expensive player after his $263 million transfer from Barcelona in 2017, could now face a three-match suspension in the Champions League, according to UEFA regulations.The case will be dealt with by the UEFA Control, Ethics and Disciplinary Body with the date of the hearing yet to be confirmed, the statement read.

It is the most important goal of my whole career, Pedersen told the club's website.I'm happy all these people came to see us. We started well in the first half even though we were a bit nervous and we perhaps did not play our best game, but it was great to do it in front of this crowd.Earlier this month,  at the Wanda Metropolitano in the Spanish capital, setting the record for the best-attended women's club game in history. The record for any women's match was set at the 1999 World Cup final when 90,185 people saw the United States beat China 5-4 on penalties at the Rose Bowl in California.

It was a beautiful gift to play in this stadium, said defender Lisa Boattin.We felt great emotion for the whole week leading up to today and seeing all those people ... left our legs shaking a little, at least in the first few minutes. Then we managed to control ourselves and bring home three very important points. The victory gives us more energy for the next matches.
